energy policy","value":"An ambitious renewables target has been set, seeing 22GW of renewables capacity added by 2030, saving 300 billion cubic meters of gas. Sectoral goals have also been detailed and include a 2020 target of 4.5GW of clean energy that is unlikely to be met. Algeria may yet scale down its ambitions in light of the large gap between installed capacity and its objectives. A feed-in tariff has de facto been replaced by tenders. Yet problems with auctions have been numerous, including successive delays and the ultimate cancellation of a 4GW tender. A PV tender held in early 2019 was undersubscribed, with only eight bidders. The lack of progress is in large part due to stringent local content rules, restrictions on the involvement of foreign actors and uncertainties about access to finance."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Most renewables capacity consists of small-scale PV installations of around 15-20MW. The domestic clean energy industry attracted investments totaling $557 million over 2006-18, but no sizable deals have been concluded over the last four years. Finance has been lackluster for a number of reasons, including a national focus on developing new gas plants while modernizing the existing power fleet. Actors bidding into auctions must do so with a local partner and finance must be domestically sourced ' a challenge as Algerian banks remain reluctant to back clean energy undertakings, despite their involvement in a handful projects over past years."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Prices for clean energy are driven up by the requirement to use locally manufactured equipment. While the domestic solar manufacturing industry has started producing panels at scale, product costs remain far higher than those sold internationally. Retail rates are relatively low by virtue of the country's rich gas resources. When compared across the region, tariffs are cheaper than in neighboring Morocco and Tunisia, but more expensive than those imposed in Egypt and oil-rich Gulf states. Prices have not been raised over past years, but low oil and gas prices have strained the public purse since they began to fall in 2014. The current political uncertainty renders reforms in this area unlikely before 2020."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Algeria opened up generation to competition in 2002, but the sector has remained dominated by Sonelgaz. The state-owned utility's dominance is ensured by its access to the country's abundant gas resources, whose cheap procurement has prevented the emergence of competitive independent power producers (IPP). The Sonelgaz group is the sole authorized retailer of power on the country's three grids. However, consumers are free to procure their own electricity through self-generation or power purchase agreements (PPA). Increasingly cheap solar technology, the high cost of diesel generation and unreliable grid power have created a favorable environment for small-scale renewables."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"An administratively burdensome bureaucracy and high taxes do little to attract investment. Sonelgaz is the offtaker for utility-scale projects. However, the utility's financials have been strained over recent years as it suffers from low commodity prices, widespread fraud and structural inefficiencies. In addition to the company having debts running up to nearly 61 billion dinars ($507 million), many of Sonelgaz's customers are behind on payments. The group launched legal proceedings against over 50 companies it claims owe it money in August 2019. Despite the possibility of arrears on payments, the risk of the offtaker defaulting is held in check by Sonelgaz being backed by the government and domestic banks."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Local content requirements are the primary hurdle to the deployment of clean energy. Another hindrance are rules limited foreign ownership of joint ventures to 49%, and the government's reluctance to issue sovereign payment guarantees, a concern in light of the possibility of Sonelgaz being restructured. In the throes of a political transition, Algeria is seen as a risky market. Similarly, past terrorist attacks have made investors think twice before financing projects in the country's southern regions."}]}
