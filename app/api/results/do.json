The country also has a net metering program, which allows retail electricity consumers who have renewable generation facilities to interconnect with the distribution company, deliver surplus generation to the grid and obtain a billing credit."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The Dominican Republic's clean energy sector attracted $1.4 billion of investment over 2010-2018. Wind energy captured the bulk of it, $746 million, followed by solar with $298 million. Over half of the investment was recorded on the past two years.

Commercial prices fell over this period from $217/MWh in 2015 to $176.60/MWh in 2018. Average industrial prices decreased from $210.69/MWh in 2015 to $145.80/MWh in 2018. In contrast, wholesale prices jumped from $96/MWh in 2015 to $141/MWh in 2018, representing an increase of 46% over the period. The culprit was retail rate subsidies, which are estimated to have cost $479 million in 2018 alone. With the commissioning of the Punta Catalina thermal power plant in 2019, the government foresees a reduction in electricity prices and subsidies."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The Dominican Republic had 3.6GW of installed capacity in 2018. Oil and diesel are the main sources of electricity, accounting for 1.6GW, or approximately 50% of total capacity. Small hydro, wind, solar and biomass together account for 13% of the total. Although generation is open to private players, it remains dominated by state-owned entities. The distribution segment is divided into three public companies: Edeeste, Edenorte and Edesur. All state-owned companies are managed by the Corporación Dominicana de Empresas Eléctricas Estatales (CDEEE)."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"In 2018, the Dominican Republic's electrification rate was 96%.

According to this document, national and international companies are allowed to participate, but additional details are not available. On May 27, 2019, CNE authorized 12 provisional concessions for electricity generation, of which two are wind projects and eight are photovoltaic projects corresponding to 874MW in total.

Renewable energy generators have dispatch priority and open access to transmission and distribution.\nBeyond that, the financial instability of the Corporación Dominicana de Empresas Eléctricas Estatales (CDEEE) and the subsidization of retail electricity prices jeopardizes project developers seeking financing and the low rates for electricity prices difficult the entrance of new energy technologies."}]}
