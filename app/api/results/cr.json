In 2017, the country ran 300 days on clean energy alone and in 2018, 98.6% of its generation came from clean energy sources including large hydro. Hydropower is still the predominant energy source, representing 73% of generation. In 2018, wind accounted for 15.8% of the total compared to 11.5% in 2017."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Costa Rica attracted $2.1 billion in new-build clean energy investment over 2010-2018. Over a third of that capital was directed to small hydro plants ($0.8 billion), followed by geothermal with $0.6 billion and wind with $0.6 billion.

These entities can be involved with generation and distribution in some parts of the country.\nIn 2018, the country had an installed capacity of 3,601MW, with hydropower representing 66% (2,387MW) of the total. Oil and wind, respectively had 16% (572MW) and 10% (378MW) of the capacity.\nTotal generation in 2018 was 11,356GWh, mainly from hydropower with 73% (8,343GWh), followed by wind with 16% (1,799GWh)."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Costa Rica's government shows strong commitment to energy and climate-related incentives. However, high hydro penetration and slow demand growth limits new entrants in the market. Around 73% of the country's power generation is supplied by hydro, reducing the need for other clean energy sources for the country to meet its goals.
