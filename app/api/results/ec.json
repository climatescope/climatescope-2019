The country did not achieve its 90% hydro target to be met by 2017, even after the addition of 2GW of hydro capacity in 2016.\nEcuador, like many countries in the region, is heavily dependent on hydropower and exposed to variations of rainfall. The government gives priority of dispatch for biomass, geothermal, small hydro, solar, tidal and wind projects. Renewable energy developers may also apply for import tax exemption on clean energy equipment and a five-year waiver on income tax. Furthermore, on November 2018 the government introduced a net metering system, applicable for residential users with an installed capacity up to 300 kW of PV technology and industrial users with up to 500 kW. Despite that, deployment of wind and solar assets have been minimal. Ecuador was one of the few countries in Latin America to have a feed-in-tariff incentive for renewables, but it is currently not in force."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investments in clean energy in Ecuador are very small. Since 2011, the total invested amounted to only $500 million, mainly in small hydro assets.

The most expressive reduction was for the industrial tariffs, from $94.90/MWh in 2017 to $80.10 in 2018, more than 15% lower. Ecuador has among of the lowest retail electricity rates in Latin America."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"In Ecuador, the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy (MEER) oversees renewable energy policy and planning. In 2015, the Act Establishing the Public Electric Power Service (LOSPEE) was published, overseeing the power sector in Ecuador. Under this law, the National Electricity Board (CONELEC) becomes the Agency for Regulation and Control of Electricity (ARCONEL). While generation is open to private players in Ecuador, transmission is under the responsibility of state-owned utility Corporación Eléctrica del Ecuador (CELEC EP Transelectric). Distribution is divided between 11 majority-public companies, in which MEER is the majority shareholder. \nIn 2018, Ecuador had a total of 8.7GW of installed capacity, with hydro representing 50% and thermal power accounting for 39% of its mix. In 2016, the country doubled its hydro capacity, which totaled 4.4GW in 2018. Clean energy, encompassing small hydro, biomass, wind and solar plants, represents 11% of total capacity."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"On October 13, 2015, the Government of Ecuador submitted its unconditional Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations, committing to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the energy sector by 20.4%-25% below the business as usual (BAU) scenario by 2025. Ecuador also committed to a further reduction of GHG emissions in the energy sector to a level between 37.5% and 45.8% below the BAU scenario by 2025. This additional reduction is conditioned upon availability of resources and international support."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Ecuador faces difficulties to deploy more renewable projects due to key characteristics of its power market. A combination of very low electricity tariffs, fossil fuel subsidies for electricity generation and low power demand growth produces a challenging environment for project developers.
