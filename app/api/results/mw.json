energy policy","value":"Historically, 90% of primary energy has come from burning biomass in Malawi and only 3% has been met by electricity. Trees are cut down to make charcoal, leading to concerns about deforestation and worsening the effects of climate change. In the National Energy Policy (NEP) of 2003, the government announced a target to meet 7% of primary energy demand with renewable generation by 2020. This was not an ambitious goal, especially given the timeline. The updated NEP of 2018 further delayed this target, taking it to 7% by 2030. The National Renewable Energy Strategy of 2017 sets out steps that the government can take to promote grid-scale renewables, mini-grids, off-grid solar and bioenergy. However, this is not a binding piece of legislation."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Malawi's government has not yet made any clean energy investments. Almost all investment in the sector has come from abroad and renewable developers operating in the country are all subsidiaries of overseas companies. International development banks are a popular source of capital. Overall, investment doesn't seem to be growing, which could be due to high inflation and volatile exchange rates disrupting investor confidence. Malawi seems willing to experiment technology-wise, as PPAs have been signed for solar, wind and small hydro. Solar is the most commonly funded technology, and a PPA was recently signed for the country's first floating solar plant."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity tariffs have steadily increased in recent years in order for the central utility to raise revenue and improve the energy deficit. Price increases are unpopular among consumers, especially given the frequent scheduled blackouts in Malawi. Fuel prices are also increasing quite significantly, which is particularly disruptive given Malawi's dependence on diesel generation for emergency power. The country does not have any significant interconnection to neighboring markets, so is unable to import power. Regulators are in discussion to open up interconnections to Zambia, which would improve power supply in the country and potentially bring prices down."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"All of Malawi's electricity generation comes from hydropower plants situated on the Shire River. In recent years, low water levels and debris clogs in the river have significantly reduced electricity output and caused severe load shedding. Malawi has no significant interconnection to neighboring countries, making the energy deficit worse. Plans are in place to connect Malawi to the Southern Africa Power Pool by 2021, which should finally make power imports possible. In 2016, the generation market opened up to IPPs and since then, PPAs have been signed for some 200 MW of new renewable generation. However, nothing has been built yet. With no IPP assets yet operational, Malawi's central generation utility EGENCO owns all generation, while its counterpart ESCOM owns transmission and distribution assets. ESCOM is the market's single offtaker."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Malawi is one of the world's least electrified countries, with an overall electrification rate of around 11%. In rural areas, this reduces to just 1%. The country's rural electrification fund has an aim of extending the existing grid, but has not yet significantly increased electrification rates, according to reported results. There is significant unmet power demand in Malawi, where only 3% of total energy demand is served by electricity. Severe load shedding has been a persistent issue across the country, causing consumer unrest and economic disruption. Resource potential for solar is high. The central utility has no plans to build solar assets of its own, but it has awarded solar PPAs to a number of developers. Malawi's generation plants are in need of modernization and upgrades, but there is no comprehensive program due to a lack of funding."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Malawi's almost complete reliance on hydropower from the Shire River is a concentrated risk. If water levels remain low, the country will need a new generation fleet to supply power. The local currency has experienced high inflation, which is a concern for foreign investors. There are no local manufacturers of equipment for solar, wind, or hydro, so everything is imported. To encourage renewable development, import tariffs have been removed for all renewable equipment. However, the quality of imports, especially for solar equipment, is often low or even non-functional. This has led to frustration and distrust among potential adopters of solar. Additionally, electricity theft is an issue and will weigh on developers' financial considerations."}]}
