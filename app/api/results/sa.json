energy policy","value":"Saudi Arabia has ambitious plans to develop clean energy, as embodied in its National Renewable Energy Program (NREP). This strategic initiative falls under the country's Vision 2030, and aims at increasing renewable energy capacity to 9.5GW by 2023, from 142MW currently, as part of its roadmap to diversify the domestic power supply and catalyze economic development. In early 2019, the solar component of the policy was expanded by almost four times: it is now targeting 20GW of solar by 2023 instead of 5.9GW, and as much as 40GW by 2030. As part of phase one of the NREP, the country's first utility-scale solar project in Sakaka, totalling 300MW, was awarded in 2018. In January 2019, EDF and Masdar won a contract to construct a 400MW wind plant in Dumat Al-Jandal. In 2019 alone, Saudi Arabia has invited bids for over 2GW of solar capacity."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"While renewables currently represent less than 1% of total installed capacity in the country, this is set to change under the NREP. To date, structural obstacles, such as subsidized energy prices and the concentration of ownership of generation assets among few institutions have stymied investment and development. The gradual opening of the energy sector to private sector participation means more players are becoming involved. For instance, Saudi-based Acwa Power, in a consortium with AlGihaz Holding Company, is developing the 300MW Sakaka PV project. It is completely underwritten by French investment bank Natixis and additionally supported by the Arab National Bank."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The country's energy prices have long been subsidized well below regional and international levels. They are, however, on the rise ' with the most recent increase implemented at the beginning of 2018. While commercial and industrial tariffs did not increase by much, residential tariffs more than tripled. The target is for energy prices to reach international levels by 2020. In the first round of NREP auctions, the winning bid for the aforementioned 300MW solar tender by local player Acwa Power came in at $2.36/MWh. Acwa was selected over an EDF bid of $1.78/MWh. While awarded projects do not usually include the costs relating to land acquisition or connecting the projects to the grid, the Saudi government will take over these costs in the first round of auctions. It is unclear whether such an arrangement will also stay in place for future tenders."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Oil accounts for the largest slice of generation capacity and this is a characteristic of the sector that Saudi Arabia is intent on changing. It will do so by developing additional non-associated and unconventional gas fields, and by adding more natural gas-fired capacity. Another big thrust for Saudi Arabia is solar and wind technology, the development of which is just beginning. The power market is currently dominated by state-owned companies, though plans exist to privatize key institutions in the sector by 2020. Currently the Saudi Electric Co., through its wholly owned subsidiary National Grid, has a monopoly on electricity power transmission, operation, control, maintenance and rent of transmission network lines. Through the auctions under the NREP program, more independent power producers will be entering the scene."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Electricity demand has grown at a very rapid clip in Saudi Arabia over the past few decades, but has plateaued since 2015. Capacity totaled just over 90GW in 2018 and has risen on average by 6% annually since 2010. This high demand, driven by an expanding economy, a growing population and the need for greater volumes of desalinated water, has driven the country's interest in diversifying power generation sources and transitioning away from the use of oil. This has prompted efforts to promote the construction of new solar-powered plants as well as gas and nuclear generation."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Several Saudi institutions question whether the projected electricity demand growth will materialize. Energy efficiency improvements, possible slowing of population growth and recent price increases for petrol and electricity may ease electricity demand growth. It is unclear what may then happen to demand for renewables. The introduction of value-added-tax as of January 2018 has made projects costlier. Moreover, potential developers must consider the 30% local content requirements ' set to rise to 60% by 2020 to boost the local manufacturing ecosystem."}]}
