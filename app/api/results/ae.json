Given the federal structure of the country, individual emirates have each determined their own objectives. Abu Dhabi and Dubai are shooting for 7% by 2020; both have also put renewables projects up for bidding. Dubai, for instance, issues tenders for renewables projects as part of its Clean Energy Strategy 2050, which aims to source 75% of power generation from clean energy by this century's halfway point. Despite the U.A.E.'s reputation as a regional trailblazer for clean energy, the country has not put in place any renewables incentives ' progress to date has largely been driven by state-backed projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investment in renewables has been considerable ' $400 million went toward funding solar plants in 2017 alone. Spending is set to skyrocket: the U.A.E. has pledged $163 billion in spending on renewables by 2050. Home-grown players such as Masdar have led a number of consortiums heading the country's main projects, such as the Shams Power solar thermal plant, commissioned in 2013 and owned by the Abu Dhabi-based developer (80%) and Total SA (20%). The project was underwritten to the tune of $600 million by a group of 10 foreign and domestic banks, underlining the extent to which sources of finance are diversified. International developers, investors and banks have spent considerable sums on the country's renewable energy initiatives."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"U.A.E. solar tenders have attracted headlines for record low tariffs: June 2016 saw the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) announce the $29/MWh price agreed on with the Masdar-led grouping chosen to complete the 800MW third phase of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park. The project's fourth stage, adding 700MW of solar thermal capacity, was awarded to a consortium of Chinese and Saudi investors with a 35-year PPA price of $0.073/kWh ' by far the lowest for the technology. The Emirates Water and Electricity Co. (EWEC) awarded the Noor Abu Dhabi 1.17GW to a joint venture of Marubeni and JinkoSolar at a low tariff of $24/MWh.

A growing project pipeline is set to increase the share of renewables ' the Ministry of Energy has set its sights on issuing tenders at a rate of 1GW a year until 2050. The 1.17GW PV plant in Abu Dhabi started commercial operations in 2017. Utilities have a monopoly on procurement, transmission and distribution.

Frequent power cuts in the poorer emirates are a thing of the past, and the population is geographically concentrated and connected to the grid ' 85% of Emiratis live in the emirates of Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah. The power authorities also have very high credit ratings. Existing thermal plants are well-maintained and the country's business environment is generally favorable, with a high degree of clarity regarding the rules and procedures underpinning energy projects."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Renewable energy projects face few hurdles in the U.A.E. The sector benefits from strong political support, with the state positioning itself as the regional champion of renewable energy by hosting the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) and underwriting domestic heavyweights such as Masdar. Offtaker risk is low and there is little chance of curtailment presenting an issue. Efforts are being made to interconnect transmission networks run by power authorities with a view to improving the grid's ability to cope with increased intermittency once solar generation begins ramping up."}]}
