energy policy","value":"The government aims to reach 20% renewable energy generation share by 2023 and 30% by 2030 ' a significant leap from the 2018 level of 7%. The legal foundation was laid by the Law on Renewable Energy (2007), while the National Renewable Energy Program (2005-2020) provided official targets and incentives for global investors in the sector. The principal incentive is the relatively generous feed-in tariff (Fit): the price paid under the power-purchase agreement negotiated with the National Dispatching Center. In addition, such FiTs are denominated in U.S. dollars and paid in tugrik, based on actual exchange rates, helping eliminate currency risk. Tax exemptions are also available for solar PV and wind turbines."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Mongolia could potentially supply 8,000TWh of wind power and 5,000 TWh of solar power per year. However, renewable energy investment has grown slowly in Mongolia, amounting to just $200 million over 2010-16. Then 2017 set a new record, at nearly $100 million, with a mild slowdown again in 2018. Due to the nascent state of the renewables sector, the majority of investment has come from international development banks and foreign governments. The single largest investor is the European Bank for Reconstruction & Development (EBRD), responsible for a cumulative investment of $120 million. The largest local developer is Newcom Group. If the country is to meet its renewable energy target, it will need an extra push for new investments in the coming years."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail electricity tariffs in Mongolia range from 110.67 tugrik ($0.04) per kWh for households to 158.23 tugrik per kWh for commercial and industrial users. This level, having climbed 60% since 2011, is higher than neighboring countries such as Kazakhstan, and just slightly lower than China. Wholesale prices for general thermal generators are at 80.86 tugrik/kWh, while the feed-in tariffs for on-grid renewables are: wind $80-95/MWh, small hydro $45-60/MWh, and solar $150-180/MWh. This level is more attractive than neighboring countries such as Kazakhstan and China. In general, costs can be higher than in other countries due to transportation and limited know-how in the local market."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Fossil fuels accounted for 93% of generation in 2018, although this may change as the highly-polluting Soviet-funded coal plants age, and as the share of renewables rises. Mongolia has four grids, with grid-connected generation capacity expanding. This should reduce Mongolia's significant reliance on electricity imports from Russia in the western grid and to a lesser extent from China in its south. Curtailment of renewables is not yet a significant issue in Mongolia. In addition, Mongolia has approximately 1MW of off-grid solar and 0.9MW of solar-wind hybrids, which typically apply to Mongolian 'towns' and 'living tents' (soums and gers) distributed in remote villages. The power market is mostly state-owned and the grid is regulated, without near-term plans for liberalization. The state is the biggest player in generation and distribution, and the National Dispatching Center is the only offtaker."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand has slowly increased in recent years but remains low ' a trend expected to continue in the coming decade. This is because GDP growth in Mongolia peaked at 17% in 2011, and has slowed down significantly since. It was as low as 1.2% in 2016. A rebound was observed in 2017 (5.9%) and 2018 (6.9%), meaning more potential opportunities for business in the country. In addition, the national electrification rate for its population of about 3 million is 88% (only 60% in rural areas), so power demand has room to grow. The country has vast land resources and good weather conditions to develop wind and solar, while mini- and off-grid systems operate well in remote areas. Mongolia also needs to modernize its coal-power fleet as it was built at least 30 years ago"},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Existing coal-fired plants have low marginal costs to operate, and demand for additional capacity appears stagnant and easily satisfied by a few of the potential projects in the pipeline. Mongolia has no manufacturing capacity for solar or wind components. Imports of such equipment can be exempted from duties and value added tax, based on pre-clearance at customs, but inland transportation can raise the costs inevitably. Foreign and private investment is welcome in the energy sector, but currency instability poses a risk given the tugrik's history of depreciation. Policy instability, such as the upcoming revision of the renewable energy law, and local administrative inefficiency, is also a potential investment barrier. Mongolia has four relatively independent grid regions, which adversely affect the wide dispatch/transmission of renewable energy."}]}
