energy policy","value":"Qatar aims to procure 200-500MW of solar energy by 2020. This represents about 5% of the national power demand. The target is ambitious given that the first renewable projects in the country are yet to be built. This means not only setting up the generation plants, but also amending and piloting new energy laws to accommodate the technology in a nation that has abundant alternative sources of power and no sustainability mandates. Pre-bids have been received for the proposed projects. While deployment might slip to 2021, there are further plans to expand solar capacity to 750MW."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"There are no clean energy investments to track yet as the first set of projects are still in the pre-bid stage. These will be solar projects as solar resources are abundant in Qatar. Investment in the projects can come from anywhere but it must not solely be from Qatari banks. Additionally, the developer can, at a maximum, own 40% of the project with the other 60% going to Strategic National Investors. Yet, the developer is responsible for sourcing all the financing."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Qatar's electricity prices are on par or lower than those of their neighbors. Much of this is due to heavy subsidies from the government and in some cases, free access to electricity. Prices might increase in the future as the government looks to set up a wholesale electricity market and remove certain subsidies it deems unsustainable. The levelized cost of electricity remains low. The country runs on power generated from natural gas, a fuel that is abundant in the region."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Natural gas has a monopoly on power generation in the country. Renewables will make a dent in this. There are no imports of gas. Renewables are meant to primarily save gas from being burned for power, as exporting the gas as LNG has more value. Clean energy is also used to diversify the sources of power. Generation capacity continues to increase as load grows at 6.5% per year. Renewables will get priority dispatch to meet the gas saving mandate. Only generation is liberalized, and there are no further plans to reform. The biggest players in the generation market are Ras Laffan and Qatar Electricity & Water Company (QEWC). The utility is the sole offtaker of electricity."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Qatar's power demand has been increasing by 6% on average for the past five years. The demand growth has, however, been quite volatile year-to-year, with a range of 1-11%. There is strong potential for off/mini-grids, mainly to power remote oil and gas operations. Solar makes the most sense to do this, as irradiation is plentiful. The main challenge would be cleaning the panels regularly, as dust storms are frequent. There is no formal power plant modernization program. Facilities than need rehabilitation and upgrades get attention on an ad-hoc basis."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"There are local companies that manufacture solar panels, but the developer must build the electric infrastructure that will connect the solar project to the main grid. The utility Kahramaa will gain ownership of the infrastructure once complete. All goods are subject to the same 5% tariff. Anyone can invest in an asset but money cannot be solely sourced from domestic banks. Strategic national investors will own at least 60% of the project. Kahramaa chooses the SNI. There is no offtaker risk as the wealthy Qatari government guarantees the project. Transmission constraints are non-existent, which limits curtailment risk. Indexation of the riyal and the dollar removes currency risk. Finding a suitable plot of land is a major challenge for renewable projects."}]}
