energy policy","value":"In December 2018, President Kenyatta said that Kenya planned to attain '100% green energy consumption by 2020'. Meanwhile there has been no legislative action to set such a target. This non-binding target appeared to include large-hydro, which accounted for more than 30% of the country's generation in 2018, and is difficult to achieve within the timeline. Still, Kenya is gradually increasing its non-large hydro renewables by adding solar, wind and geothermal. The government no longer offers a feed-in tariff for these technologies after more than 4GW of capacity applied, which the grid system cannot absorb. The country is in the process of shifting from a feed-in tariff scheme to an auction-based one, but no further details have been announced even though parliament approved a draft bill in August 2018."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investments in Kenya have been sporadic in the last decade, sustained by a small number of financings for geothermal and wind projects. Kenya recorded $1.4 billion of total investment in 2018, the highest since BloombergNEF started tracking it. This includes $233 million for Actis Kipeto Wind Farm from Overseas Private Investment, and $143 million from Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) and Agence Française de Developpement (AfD). The majority of financing for large-scale renewable energy projects came from development financing institutes and donor organizations. The distributed energy startups such as pay-as-you-go solar companies, microgrid and on-site energy developers received financing from more diverse financiers, including strategic investors, commercial banks and utilities."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Kenya's electricity tariffs are set by the Electricity Act of 2006. They had tended to increase in recent years and jumped 8-21% from 2017 to 2018. Kenya Power introduced off-peak tariffs for commercial and industrial customers in December 2017, which are applicable during the night time if a customer meets a certain threshold of monthly power consumption. Power prices in Kenya are higher compared to neighboring economies such as Ethiopia, where cheap large-hydro power is available, and Tanzania, where the government keeps tariffs lower than generation costs."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The liberalization of the generation market has seen more than 10 independent power producers cut into KenGen's market share. The government has also mandated Ketraco to compete with Kenya Power on transmission. In March 2019, the president signed the Energy Bill 2017, which liberalized the electricity retail market on paper. But, the market has been so far monopolized by Kenya Power in practice and it would take another year or more to set up detailed regulations. Large hydro and geothermal are the two main sources of Kenya's generation mix. The share of non-large hydro renewables generation reached 52.3% in 2018, with some contribution from Lake Turkana wind and Garissa solar plants that started operation late in the year."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Kenya's peak power demand has seen moderate growth of 6.3% CAGR from 2010/11 to 2017/18, reaching 1,802MW. It was driven by growing demand from residential customers that could benefit from a subsidized grid connection cost, and from commercial as well as industrial customers. Kenya Power introduced a night-time discounted tariff for commercial and industrial customers in December 2017. But, it has not stimulated consumers to increase power demand as intended, likely because of strict criteria for the use of night-time tariffs. Kenya has the largest off-grid solar market in Sub-Saharan Africa, and is poised to grow further under its National Electrification Strategy launched in December 2018, which aims to attain universal access by 2022."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Land access has been a challenge for both site selection and transmission connection. Developers usually spend two years to negotiate with land owners to acquire land. They also need to identify the successors of the registered owners in cases where they are not alive, which is sometimes difficult. They are not permitted to use agricultural lands. Generally, it takes a long time for administrative processes including grid connection and a power purchase agreement (two years for PPA negotiation). For small-scale renewable energy projects, the regulatory framework only requires a permit for those with a generation capacity of 1-3MW and requires no permit or licence for those below 1MW projects. Regulations for on-site generation are relatively light-handed."}]}
