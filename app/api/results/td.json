energy policy","value":"Chad has been slow to set up renewable energy incentives. As a first step, the government created the Agency for the Development of Renewable Energy (ADER) within the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, which is accountable for renewables-based electrification, among other responsibilities. The government has not set a national target regarding renewable energy deployment or passed any further supporting policies. Nevertheless, the 2019 revision of the country's finance law includes a provision on clean energy. This provision stipulates that any equipment relevant to the generation and promotion of renewable energy be exempt from import duties and value-added tax."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"There are hardly any investments in clean energy in Chad, with all finance to-date exclusively coming from outside the country and disbursed at concessional rates. There are less active financiers than in neighboring countries, with the main actors being the EU, the World Bank and the Islamic Development Bank. After a delay of two years, the 60MW Djermaya Solar plant was the first utility-scale renewable energy project to be announced in the country in 2018. The EU is backing the project with a 6.35 million-euro ($7.3 million) grant. Funding is scarce. Indeed, the difficulties in securing financing were partly behind the repeated delays that affected Vergnet's 1.1MW wind farm at Amdjarass, which finally came online for initial testing in late-2017."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Chad's government heavily subsidizes power retail tariffs, which have remained unchanged since their last adjustment in 2012. As the government is committed to increasing the population's access to cheap electricity, there is little chance of rates rising in the short-term. The tariffs are nonetheless higher than in most neighboring countries. Electricity costs are difficult to determine due to the lack of detail on capacity additions."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Chad's current generation fleet is exclusively powered by fossil fuels. Procurement, transmission and distribution are the state utility's prerogative, but independent producers can sell their own output, with Société Nationale d'Electricité du Tchad (SNE) purchasing electricity from a 20MW thermal plant owned and operated by VPower, as well as NRC's 20MW thermal plant. Vergnet's aforementioned wind plant does not seem to be generating power so far. A further IPP, Aggreko, entered the market in mid-2019 with a 24MW heavy fuel oil plant. SNE is the sole procurer of all power generation, so corporations are unable to purchase the own energy via power purchase agreements. A law setting out more detailed regulations for IPPs, which clarifies the procedures and penalties, remains stuck in the National Assembly."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Despite having one of the world's lowest electrification rates, and an official commitment toward providing electricity to 15% of the rural population by 2023, no coordinated electrification plan has been launched to date. Microgrid projects are few and far between, but offer great potential in improving electrification rates, especially given the large distances in the country. There are persistent concerns about the lack of investment in transmission and distribution, with grid congestion a particular issue for projects in and around the capital N'djamena."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Chad's fragile security environment is an overarching barrier to project development. Additionally, the lack of incentivizing legal framework, finance and transparency further diminishes the country's attractiveness to investors. The grid is in need of improvement and expansion prior to adding significant new-build. This has slowed down the development of the Djermaya Solar plant, for example. The state utility SNE is unable to recover its costs due to the mandated price subsidies as outlined above, but seems to have been able to meet its contractual obligations so far."}]}
