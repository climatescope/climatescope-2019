energy policy","value":"Kuwait's 2030 Energy Strategy sets out to secure 15% of electricity generation from renewable energy sources by 2030. Even though the energy mix remains largely hydrocarbon-based, progress has been made in the past years with the deployment of solar (both PV and solar thermal) and onshore wind projects. And more larger-scale projects are either under development or in the pipeline. The 15% target is achievable if the government continues its efforts in investing and supporting renewable energy. The development of renewable energy is in line with the country's overall goal of freeing up fossil fuels for more value added sectors like oil refining and petrochemicals, which makes the policy more likely to be stable and consistent."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The deployment of renewables started very recently in Kuwait, translating into high growth rates from very small bases. The bulk of renewable generation is solar (both PV and solar thermal), with onshore wind accounting for the rest. No other renewable energy technologies are set to be developed, but some hybrid projects are in planning. The country does not have financial institutions solely dedicated to green investments, but domestic banks have been active in financing renewable energy projects. Increasing capacity is funded through the private-public-partnership (PPP) model. For example, the Az-Zour North Power and Water plant uses the PPP model and initial public offering to secure financing. The aim is to increase the private ownership in more projects."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Consumption of energy is heavily subsidized in Kuwait. Electricity prices are among the lowest in the Middle East. These subsidies distort the allocation of resources by encouraging excessive consumption, accelerating the depletion of natural resources and undermining the growth potential of renewables. This results in the highest per capita energy consumption in the world. The government increased electricity prices for the residential (expatriates only) and commercial sectors in Kuwait in 2017. However, electricity prices are much lower than the cost of generation, and the subsidy level is still very high even after the price increase. There's more to be done to encourage rational use of electricity and investment in the renewable sector."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Fossil fuels account for the largest part of Kuwait's power generation. The country has increased the share taken by gas-fired power plants in the past years, and will continue to do so in the future. Renewable energy accounts for less than 1% of its total capacity. A number of projects are under construction or in the pipeline to meet the 2030 renewable target of 15%. The Kuwait Authority for Partnership Projects oversees the development of PPAs according to law 116 of 2014. However, there is little experience in this area. The first phase of the Az-Zour North IWPP was the first IPP in Kuwait, but the model is yet to be refined so it can provide a benchmark for future developments."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"According to the Ministry of Electricity and Water, electricity consumption is growing at approximately 8% a year, meaning capacity needs to double every decade to meet demand. This is the result of several factors, namely wasteful resource consumption on the back of heavily subsidized energy prices, population growth, and a nascent petrochemical industry. By 2018, renewables accounted for a negligible 1% of capacity, but Kuwait's abundant solar and wind resources offer the potential for a quick ramp up. Data from Irena has measured Kuwait's solar global horizontal irradiance at 1,900 KWh/m2/year, while the potential for wind stands at as much as 1,605 hours/year. Although no explicit fleet modernization program has been announced, Kuwait is building capacity in response to the forecasted growth in electricity demand."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Kuwait has a very stable government and provides a good environment for investment. Laws governing the sector are transparent and often available in English, and the country maintains a strong credit rating, with high liquidity in the domestic banking sector. In contrast to other countries in the region, Kuwait is safe and full of opportunity. The government is striving to attract foreign investment as a way to grow the local economy, create jobs, and promote technology transfer. However, the effort to grow the share of renewables in generation lacks a consolidated approach. Effort fragmentation is common, with the work split between research institutes, the government and the private sector, which undermines the development of a national strategy to meet the country's energy target."}]}
