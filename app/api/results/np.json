energy policy","value":"Nepal established the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC) in 1996, with an initial focus on household supply, such as small hydropower access and biogas for cooking. The renewable energy policy was introduced in 2006, followed by the National Rural and Renewable Energy Program in 2012, targeting 25MW mini and micro hydro, 600,000 solar home systems as well as setting goals for biogas, water pumps and solar cookers. The subsidies started in 2012 were generous and ambitious, but the program has not added much capacity in the renewables sector. On the contrary, high subsidy rates have prevented the country from attracting complementary investments on the basis of market. The policy in force today ' Renewable Energy Subsidy Policy 2016 ' is relatively stable and clear for market entrants. Technologies qualifying for subsidies include mini- to small-hydro, solar PV, solar thermal, biogas, biomass, wind and solar-wind hybrid systems. It provides different levels of subsidy to areas with national grid access and off-grid installations. The rates are rarely adjusted, and not cost-reflective. No auctions or power market is in place. Many plans have been initiated to attract investments, but progress has been slow."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Various funds have been set up by the government for the development of renewables, such as the Central Renewable Energy Fund and the Small Hydro Power Fund. However, the authorities admit that the lack of mobilization of credit and high dependence on subsidies has been hampering further investments in renewable energy. Nepal has huge potential for hydro, while some wind and solar power is installed. International donors such as World Bank, Asian Development Bank and United Nations Development Program (UNDP) have financed projects in the past, and policies and subsidies have been introduced to promote foreign direct investments as well. The country needs to attract more than 28 trillion rupees ($268 billion) in foreign capital to the energy sector by 2045, as quoted in Nepal's 2017 Investment Summit. China is becoming a new major investor in Nepal, with its own hydro technology and funding."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"According to the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA)'s annual report, its average price of electricity sold is 8.14 rupees per kWh, whereas the average power tariff paid to generators is 7.52 rupees per kWh. There is no mechanism of tariff adjustment, so the price keeps relatively stable. The power price is relatively low compared to neighboring countries such as India, mainly because hydropower dominates Nepalese installed capacity and runs on lower marginal cost. This low-cost power also means that the willingness to expand power generation in Nepal is restricted. In fact, the NEA has reported losses for consecutive years. Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted a policy dialogue with the NEA as early as 2016, which highlighted the need for tariff revisions on a regular basis."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Hydro is the main (99%) of power generating source in Nepal. No fossil fuel is used for powering the Himalayan country, except for diesel consumed by back-up generators widely adopted in commercial and industrial facilities, and at home. Nepal experiences serious shortages of power: many people remain with restricted access to electricity, while those with access have regular or irregular blackouts. The situation will likely change as the country builds more hydro, and introduces wind and solar as new sources. Its power generation and transmission is bundled and dominated by a single state-owned entity ' Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA). Some independent power producers exist, and the country plans to encourage such producers to increase supply. Nepal imports power regularly from India to meet power demand, especially during the dry season."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Nepal's power generation grew more than 20% in 2017 and close to 10% in 2018, but demand continues to exceed supply of power. In fact, the shortage of power has become one of the most important barriers to better economic growth. The electrification rate is 85%, and 100% is targeted by 2030. With only 2% of the total estimated 42GW of hydro resource tapped, the expected demand of 17,400GWh by 2027 may not be met."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Nepal aims to increase foreign investment in the energy sector, both in the hydro and non-hydro renewable energy sectors. The country has not been able to attract significant investment because of the high risks related to the offtaker, curtailment, foreign exchange risks, as well as inadequate infrastructure and cumbersome government procedures. Projects under construction can be put on hold because of natural disasters in the country. Tariffs are considered not always sufficient for investors seeking payback within a reasonable timeframe."}]}
