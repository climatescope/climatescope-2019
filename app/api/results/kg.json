energy policy","value":"Kyrgyz Republic generates less than 2% of its power from renewable energy sources (excluding large hydro), but aims to increase this share to 10% by 2021. The main policy enabling this is its 'Forty Steps to a New Era' program, which calls for the construction of 11 new small hydro power plants, with a capacity of about 160MW, over the next three years. Small hydro plants are able to take advantage of a feed-in tariff offered by the energy regulator and are exempt from most value-added tax and customs duties. The country only has about 80MW of small hydro installed now. Large hydro accounts for nearly 80% of Kyrgyz Republic's installed power capacity. Around 45% of country's power plants are operating beyond their useful life and would need replacement over the next few years."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Kyrgyz Republic has not seen substantial investment in clean energy. The generation tariffs were designed to ensure investment recovery in up to eight years, but even this did not boost renewable energy installations. The country's installed small hydro capacity has remained flat in recent years and the deployment of other renewables, such as wind and solar, has been negligible to date. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are active in Kyrgyz Republic, and have provided grants to support various governmental clean energy and energy efficiency initiatives."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Kyrgyz Republic, like many of its neighbors in the former Soviet Union, has low power prices due to government subsidies. While electricity rates have increased slightly in recent years, prices for residential customers remain among the lowest in the world (at just $0.01/kWh) and far below the level needed for full cost recovery. The World Bank estimated the cumulative debt of the energy sector companies to be at 96.7 billion som ($1.4 billion) at the end of 2017. This is roughly 20% of the country's annual GDP. Electricity prices will have to increase significantly in order to pay this debt in a timely manner, according to the bank."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Kyrgyz Republic does not have a competitive wholesale market. While the country's vertically integrated state-owned utility, Kyrgyzenergo, was formally unbundled in 2001, state-controlled entities continue to dominate in each segment. Electric Power Plants JSC, for example, controls nearly 98% of power generation, the National Electric Energy Transmitting Co. has a monopoly in power transmission and four companies (that is, Vostokelectro, Jalalabatelectro, Oshelectro and Severelectro) handle nearly all power distribution. Kyrgyz Republic's installed power capacity has remained flat in recent years, at around 3.8GW, but the country needs more capacity. Renewables play only a nominal role in the country's power sector."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The country's electrification rate is near 100%, but the Kyrgyz Republic suffers from power supply reliability issues due to its dependence on large hydropower plants, most of which are operating beyond their intended lifespan. While peak power demand has remained flat in recent years, the country needs to install additional power capacity and invest in existing plants in order to address reliability concerns and enable economic growth. Kyrgyz Republic has seen GDP growth of around 4% for the past five years. It is likely this would be higher if power outages were less frequent."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Kyrgyz Republic is at the 70th position on the World Bank's global 'ease of doing business' 2019 rankings. Among all the criteria for assessing the rank, the country's worst performance is on parameter of 'getting electricity'. There are numerous barriers to renewable energy development in Kyrgyz Republic, and organic market growth remains unlikely. While the government has introduced some support mechanisms for small hydro, policy support for wind and solar is nonexistent. The industry is too nascent for foreign developers to enter the market and there are a number of barriers to doing business in Kyrgyz Republic, such as unclear land allocation regulations, inconsistent legal frameworks, insufficient local expertise and weak enforceability of commercial contracts. International development banks are working to tackle some of these market challenges."}]}
