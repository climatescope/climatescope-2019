Its National Development Plan 2017-2020 commits to a total installed capacity of 4.9GW by 2020, with a 1.4GW expansion in hydro capacity, 411MW of new wind, biomass, geothermal and solar and 1.1GW of new combined cycle and gas generation. In its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, Bolivia commits to a goal of increasing its share of 'alternative' energy (wind, biomass, geothermal and solar) and other sources of energy (combined cycle) to 9% in 2030, up from 7% in 2017. In 2014, the country published Decree 2048 to encourage clean energy development."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Development of clean energy projects in Bolivia is led by state-owned Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (ENDE), with investment coming from international development banks and the Central Bank of Bolivia. The role of solar generation solidified in 2018, as ENDE commissioned 65MW in Tarija and Potosi, a large increase compared to the 5MW project in Pando installed in 2015. A 50MW PV plant, financed by European development agencies, was also commissioned in Oruro in 2019. Bolivia's first wind farm, Qollpana phase I (3MW) was commissioned in 2014 with a second phase (24MW) brought online in 2016. A pipeline of four wind projects, financed over 2017-18, may further the addition of 132MW of new capacity in the near term."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Bolivia's electricity prices are set by the government and, as a natural gas producer, dependent on heavily subsidized gas-powered generation. However, only 67% of the 9.9TWh generated in 2018 came from gas plants, compared to 72% from the previous year. The share of hydro-powered generation has increased from 23% to 26% and the share of solar generation has increased from 0.1% to 1.3%. Electricity prices continue to rise, although rates remain low compared to most countries in Latin America. In 2018, the average retail electricity price was $0.12/kWh, up 4.5% from 2017."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Bolivia's power market is dominated by natural gas, which accounts for 50% of generation. Government-subsidized pricing limits the competitiveness of renewables. However, Bolivia is seeking to expand its hydroelectric capability to 74% of capacity by 2025 (up from 30% in 2018) and allow the country to export electricity. Despite the subsidized competition from fossil fuel, renewable generation, such as from the Uyuni and Ouro solar plants, now accounts for 4% of total capacity. ENDE is responsible for most generation, transmission and distribution."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Bolivia's energy reform prioritizes the electrification of rural areas, aiming for universal access by 2025. By consequence, demand for electricity is rapidly growing, rising 5% annually on average since 2010. Much rural electrification takes the form of off-grid projects, mainly relying on thermoelectric generators and solar photovoltaics. Business opportunities for renewables are on the rise after the first projects were commissioned in the past year. The largest planned projects are hydroelectric dams, as the country views them as the fastest way to achieve clean energy targets and increase exports to neighbors."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Renewable energy is hindered by Bolivia's reliance on heavily subsidized natural gas, which lowers power prices and blocks competition. The nationalized energy sector and foreign companies also lack clear incentives to grow renewable capacity, and projects must be financed without the option of PPAs. There is no in-country manufacturing capacity for solar or wind components, so those technologies must be imported. The government announced it would reduce tariffs for solar panels from 12% to zero in late 2018."}]}
