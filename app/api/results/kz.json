energy policy","value":"Kazakhstan has a goal of generating 3% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020, increasing to 10% by 2030. The country offered feed-in tariffs to promote renewables development, but under the coaching of European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the International Renewable Energy Agency, and the United States Agency for International Development (three institutions that have advised the country on how to speed the development of renewable energy penetration or are lending money with which to do so), it has migrated to an auctions-based system. While nearly 1,000MW of capacity was auctioned in 2018, a second year auction only seeks an additional 255MW. Ambitious renewable energy targets are inconsistent with policy to contain future tariff increases. Without passing on high renewable energy costs, funding these subsidies will remain a challenge."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Since 2010, renewable energy has grown from 136MW (largely small hydro) to 530MW, with 80% of that capacity split between small hydro and solar photovoltaic systems. Onshore wind makes up the balance of renewables. Foreign institutions investing alongside the EBRD have contributed to the majority of new renewable projects.  One of the key priorities for the EBRD is supporting Kazakhstan's efforts in regulatory reform, addressing utility tariff setting and expanding renewable energy. Kazakhstan, in 2018, replaced its feed-in tariff with renewable energy auctions. The auction program, however, was pared back in 2019. The tenge depreciated 14% against the U.S. dollar in 2018, and currency risk continues to be a challenge for renewable developers, as well as for the bankability of the power purchase agreement with the Financial Settlement Company."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices in Kazakhstan differ from region to region, and by the amount of electricity consumed. The average retail electricity price in the country, including distribution, value-added tax and fees, is $0.04/kWh as a result of government subsidies. In neighboring Russia and China, average prices are at $0.07/kWh and $0.08/kWh. Bringing renewables into the system at an average price of 31.68 tenge ($0.083)/kWh will strain the resources of the Financial Settlement Company, with which all renewable generators sign power purchase agreements, as this is higher than the retail tariffs. The introduction of renewables auctions has lowered the cost previously paid to developers through feed-in tariffs."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Power generated in Kazakhstan comes predominantly from Soviet-era plants that are old and inefficient and burn high ash coal of which the country has a 300-year supply.  Fossil fuels generate 87% of the electricity generated. Though there is a mandate to green part of the power generation infrastructure with up to 10% renewables by 2030, it will be difficult to do so due to the comparatively inexpensive price of this fuel and technology. Although there is favorable policy in place to expand renewables, the economics of doing so and the entrenchment of fossil fuel resources in terms of employment and infrastructure will prove to be challenging obstacles. Kazakhstan's abundant coal resource and well-developed transmission infrastructure have positioned the country as a net energy exporter in recent years."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Electricity generation reached 103 billion KWh in 2017, having more than doubled since 2000. Demand increased at an annual average rate of 4.4% through 2012, slowed over 2013-16 due to an economic downturn, then rebounded in 2017 to over 6%. Electricity is predominantly generated in the north by inefficient Soviet-era coal plants, while demand is greatest in the south, surrounding Almaty ' the country's largest city. The grid connecting the two regions does not extend westward to the oil producing regions adjacent the Caspian Sea. There is a potential for robust wind and solar development. However, formidable investment, and government reversals of regulation and reform, remain challenges."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Kazakhstan has worked with the EBRD, the Asian Development Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and the World Trade Organization to enhance the attractiveness of doing business in the country. It now leads the region in economic growth: 4.1% in 2018 and 3.8% in 1Q 2019. Foreign direct investment reached $24.3 billion in 2018. Although challenges exist -- rule of law, currency, infrastructure, and land use -- government bodies are working to address these and to modernize legislation.  The Astana International Financial Center has become a hub to manage assets and to engage with large institutions and private investors. Customs duty exemptions are available for imported equipment and spare parts for priority investment projects, or if local substitutes are unavailable."}]}
