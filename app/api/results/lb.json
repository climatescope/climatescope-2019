energy policy","value":"Lebanon aims to generate 12% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020, have 5GW of renewables installed and a 30% share of renewables in final energy consumption by 2030 under the National Renewable Energy Action Plan. It has made headway toward this target, with 380MW of solar and wind projects signing PPAs to date. However, administrative bottlenecks have delayed financial close and the start of construction. The tenders for 300MW of PV-plus-storage and 500MW of onshore wind projects were under instruction as of September 2019. Government support for renewables is stable ' the elections in 2018 maintained the political status quo, and renewables benefit from cross-party support. The downside to this is that there is little chance the severe underinvestment and frequent blackouts that plague the power sector will be addressed soon."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The current pipeline of renewables projects will ensure strong growth in the sector in Lebanon. Following the signature of PPAs for 180MW of solar in 2017, the PPAs for the first 200MW of wind developed in the country were signed in February 2018 at a price of $113/MWh. A further 800MW of projects could sign PPAs in the coming years as a result of further tender rounds. The Lebanese Centre for Energy Conservation received considerable expressions of interest for its tenders, including both local and major international developers such as ACWA Power, First Solar and Tesla, amongst others. Investment in the first round of auctions has come mostly from domestic sources. The National Renewable Energy Action Plan targets $1.7 billion of investment to develop the renewables sector."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The government subsidizes electricity prices in the form of cheap diesel and heavy fuel oil for the state utility, électricité du Liban (EDL), which sells electricity to the grid significantly below its cost of generation. The World Bank estimates that this massive strain on public finances is responsible for 40% of all government debt since 1992, two years before retail tariffs were frozen. However, any movement toward more cost-reflective power prices remains politically untenable. EDL's inability to meet electrical demand has spawned a large fleet of private diesel generators. These supply the grid during the daily blackouts, which may last three hours in Beirut and up to 12 hours in rural areas. Despite their illegality, these generators contribute an estimated 23% of all electricity. The PPA for the first round of wind auctions was at $113/MWh. The LCOE of solar PV in Lebanon will likely be competitive in the context of the country's diesel-dominated power sector. By 2018, small-scale PV solutions already totaled around 60MW, with more in development as solar cost continue to drop."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"EDL has a monopoly on transmission and distribution as well as retail of electricity. Any reforms to EDL or the power market are unlikely in the current political stalemate. Diesel and heavy-fuel generation dominate Lebanon's power mix in the form of ageing plants, leased power ships, or illegal private generators. The country imports some electricity from the Syrian interconnector. The law authorizing IPPs is still pending implementation; however, an exceptional decree granting the executive temporary powers to license new projects, which was introduced in 2014 and extended for three years in April 2019, has made the current pipeline of projects possible."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Lebanon's power demand is difficult to estimate as much of it is unmet or provided by the fleet of black-market diesel generators. In recent years, an estimated 490MW of additional demand has come from the 1.5 million Syrian refugees present in the country. Forecast demand growth is modest. However, significant investment is required before current demand can be met. Lebanon enjoys high electrification rates and has few off-grid developments, although this sector represents opportunities to reduce dependence on the chronically unreliable grid. In terms of natural resources, Lebanon has abundant solar potential and previous studies have suggested wind potential between 1.5GW to 6GW of capacity."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"In some regards, barriers to renewable investment in Lebanon remain low; so far, no tenders have stipulated local content requirements, there are no restrictions on foreign investment, and renewable energy equipment does not attract import duties or tariffs (but it is subject to Lebanese sales tax). The country has some manufacturing capacity, but most renewables equipment will likely still be imported. In contrast to this, considerable red tape surrounds the current IPP tendering procedures and political considerations can increase the time taken to reach decisions. Finally, offtaker risk could be considerable, given the poor financial situation of EDL, in addition to curtailment risks in the form of transmission and distribution constraints in the underfunded grid."}]}
