energy policy","value":"Liberia introduced energy targets in 2009 for 30% of electricity and 10% overall energy consumption to originate from renewable sources by 2030, which is not overly ambitious given the country's heavy reliance on hydropower and its large solar resource. \nNo policy mechanisms, such as feed-in tariffs or auctions, have been introduced ' making it difficult for renewable energy development to prosper. Developers must instead reach a bilateral agreement with the state-owned utility if seeking to supply the main grid. PPA guidelines for independent power producers are being developed.\nThe Rural and Renewable Energy Agency was established in 2015 and microgrid operators have since become active across several communities formerly without access to power. A dedicated microgrid policy is currently under development."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The lack of a transparent and uniform policy framework has hindered clean energy investment in Liberia. Commercial lenders are yet to enter the market, leaving only concessional agencies to support the limited roll-out of rural electrification projects. Independent renewable power producers are not active, despite policy allowing project operators to sell power to the state-owned utility. However, the country has attracted some foreign private-sector involvement; most notably Manitoba Hydro International, which led the refurbishment of the Mount Coffee Hydropower Plant under tender from the Liberia Electricity Corp."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Liberia's retail electricity prices have declined significantly in recent years as a result of the refurbishment of Mount Coffee Hydropower Plant, which brought a low-cost supply to the heavily constrained power system. Regulated tariffs, which are equal across all customer types, dropped by more than 40% over 2015-17, to $0.35/kWh today, and rates stayed the same in 2018. Factors that could place upward pressure on power prices include substantial investment required in the LEC grid and potential subsidizing of new renewable energy projects."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"LEC is a state-owned monopoly responsible for generation, transmission, distribution, retail and system operation in Liberia. The utility owns and operates a small fleet of mostly hydroelectric generators, including the 88MW Mount Coffee Hydropower Plant, which was returned to service in December 2016 after being offline for 26 years through civil turmoil and the ebola outbreak. LEC also procures power from independent producers ' mostly embedded diesel generators. The LEC grid is concentrated around Monrovia and the remainder of the country is not electrified, with microgrid regulation in the process of being set up. Liberia receives 8MW of power from neighboring Cote d'Ivoire and will receive an additional 27MW once the West Africa Power Pool is complete."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The refurbishment of the Mount Coffee Hydropower Plant was a game-changer for the Liberian energy system. Power quality and reliability has since improved, and retail rates have dropped. However, demand for electricity far exceeds supply and significant grid issues persist. Customers complain of long wait times for new connections, and power producers have struggled to enter into agreement to supply LEC. Outside of Monrovia, microgrid development has commenced despite the lack of a dedicated policy framework and regulatory oversight. Import duty exemptions on clean energy equipment brought into the country by aid organizations have been exploited by developers cycling products through eligible agencies. There is significant potential for new solar and hydro projects but regulatory conditions need to improve."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"A number of barriers are preventing clean energy from taking hold in Liberia. These include a lack of clear policy enablers, a financially-unstable utility and a regulatory commission that is still in the process of being set up. There is poor grid reliability and the Liberia Electricity Corporation is also known for being very slow to connect customers and generators to the network. The distinct wet and dry seasons in Liberia also present challenges for planning and operating a system dependent on hydroelectric generation."}]}
