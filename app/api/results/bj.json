energy policy","value":"Benin's authorities are opening up the country's electricity sector to private investors in a bid to increase supply and competition. They are doing so via a number of legislative reforms. On April 13 2018, the country's parliament adopted an amended version of the international agreement on the Benin-Togolese Electricity Code. As a result, the country's utility CEB (Benin Electric Community) lost the single buyer status that it has enjoyed since 1968, and is in charge of energy transmission. Furthermore, in June 2018, Benin's National Assembly adopted law number 2018-18 regulating climate change, and February 2018 saw the creation of the UC/PDER, Entity in Charge of Renewable Energy Policy Development. In parallel, the Millennium Challenge Account II (MCA II) ' a foreign aid agency backed by the U.S. government ' is on a four-year mission to help the government develop new energy projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The MCA II plans to invest $375 million to modernize Benin's electric power sector and the government of Benin will contribute an additional $28 million. Although no large-scale renewable project is yet present in Benin, at least 75MW of solar PV is planned. The MCA II launched a tender for the construction of four PV projects totaling 50MW in July 2019. These will be developed under the build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) model and will sell power to the country's state-owned utility Société Beninoise d'énergie Electrique (SBEE) under a 20-year PPA.  In December 2017, the French Development Agency (AFD) financed the 25MW 'Defissol' PV project, which is planned to come online by the end of 2020. On top of new solar developments, the program hopes to restore the 500kW Y'ripao Dam, and install a second turbine to increase production to 1MW."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity access is low, at just 32% percent of the population (Rural 11%, Urban 56%). In addition, domestic production covers only 12% of domestic consumption, with the remainder sourced from lower-cost imports. In past years, the Government of Benin has contracted expensive thermal power generation to address outages due to the unavailability of power imports arising from temporary supply challenges in Ghana and Nigeria. The regulated retail tariffs are high by regional norms, but are not sufficient to cover the costs of local generation. These correspond to $0.19 U.S. dollar/kWh, which is about 40-50% higher than the average in Sub Saharan Africa. The expensive generation mix and inability to cover costs has led the country's distribution utility SBEE (Société Béninoise d'Energie Electrique) into financial distress. Moreover, SBEE's combined grid losses are high at 24%, and the income of the utility only covered 80% of its costs in 2017."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Benin relies on thermal generation, with a heavy dependence on neighboring countries. In March 2019, the 120MW Maria Gleta II Heavy Fuel Oil and Gas plant began operating, and the country still has virtually no renewable energy projects to date aside from a 500-kilowatt hydro project. The planned PV projects should help Benin to reduce its energy dependence by building up local energy capacity. Benin is also trying to diversify supply through the construction of a Floating Storage Regasification Unit in the port of Cotonou to supply the 300MW dual fuel Maria Gl'ta power plants starting from 2020. Finally, Benin is also planning additional electricity transmission interconnections within the regional market. So far, the grid has mostly served the south of the country, whereas the northern part of Benin is relatively isolated and has limited access to cost-efficient sources of energy."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The MCA II program sets Benin on a good track to develop its energy sector. The aim of the program is to reinforce the power market and hopefully see spillover effects into other sectors, spurring economic activity. The country has important off-grid electrification potential, with only 11% of the rural population currently able to access electricity. The OCEF, subsidiary of the MCA II, has set up a fund for off-grid electrification. A first call for proposals closed in May 2018, while a second round ran from December 2018 to March 2019. BNEF's tool tracking export destinations of solar PV cells and modules from China recorded $17.6 million worth of PV exports between 2015 and 2Q 2019. However, the Port of Cotonou is one of the largest in West Africa and we cannot exclude that these goods were re-exported to other sub-Saharan countries."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Up until mid-2018, CEB was the single buyer and producer for Benin, discouraging IPPs from playing in the market. The decision of the Government of Benin to increase national generation with IPPs will lead to downstream activity in the solar sector. Since there have been no large-scale projects to date, the energy value chain is limited. The lack of existing regulation, or of previous projects, means that project development steps and bureaucracy is unclear. Furthermore, the transmission grid is limited, making the development of large-scale project renewable energy projects particularly challenging."}]}
