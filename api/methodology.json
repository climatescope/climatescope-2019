  "content": "<h2 id=\"scope\">Scope</h2>\n\n<p>Climatescope 2019 covers 104 emerging markets, or virtually all non-OECD economies with over 2 million inhabitants, plus Chile, Mexico and Turkey, which are defined as OECD countries but are among the most attractive emerging markets for clean energy. Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Yemen and Libya are not included due to local conflicts or international sanctions.</p>\n\n<p>Climatescope nations account for 82% of the world’s population, 38% of GDP and two thirds of CO2 emissions. These countries also represented 56% of global inflows to clean energy projects in 2018.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"methodology\">Methodology</h2>\n\n<p>The Climatescope 2019 methodology includes 167 indicators and sub-indicators split into three key topic areas that encompass each country’s previous accomplishments, current investment environment, and future opportunities for clean energy growth. These are the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Fundamentals.</strong> This topic area encompasses a country’s clean energy policies, power sector structure and regulations as well as local barriers that might obstruct renewable energy development. A country with comprehensive and strong policies and a more liberalized power sector tends to be more welcoming to private investment than one with weaker frameworks and less liberalization. This topic area seeks to assess the fundamental structures that can help clean energy flourish.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Opportunities.</strong> This includes a country’s current and future electricity demand, its energy consumption, and its CO2 emissions from the power sector, along with overall price attractiveness, short- and medium term opportunities for renewable energy procurement, history of corporate commitment with sustainability and existing electrification rates. This topic area seeks to encapsulate future opportunities for clean energy growth available in a country.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Experience.</strong> This includes a country’s volume of installed clean energy, historical levels of renewable energy investment and the comprehensiveness of its non-manufacturing clean energy value chains. Markets with greater experience deploying renewable energy capacity typically offer lower risks, lower technology costs and lower costs of capital for investors.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is important to note that several key indicators are “levelized” against a country’s gross domestic product, population, installed capacity and generation. The methodology seeks to take into account and then discount the fact that some nations attract larger volumes of capital simply because they are bigger.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"list-of-indicators-and-definition\">List of indicators and definition</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"fundamentals\">FUNDAMENTALS</h3>\n\n<p>Ambition of Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC): compares the objectives set out by governments in there NDC under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) with their historic emissions trend to evaluate the ambition of their emissions reduction goals.</p>\n\n<p>NDC target coverage: rewards countries based on the number of sectors that are covered by their emissions reduction goals.</p>\n\n<p>NDC target type: rewards countries that detail their emissions reduction goals in absolute terms the most, followed by those that use emission intensity targets.
