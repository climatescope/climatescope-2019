energy policy","value":"Zimbabwe's target to reach 1GW of renewables by 2025 (excluding large hydro) is ambitious, given that the country is essentially starting from zero renewable generation at present and it also faces ongoing issues with unmet demand and load-shedding. The target is not officially in place and is therefore non-binding. Solar is the most promising form of renewable generation and several IPPs have signed PPAs. In July 2019, the government announced that all new construction projects in the country must include solar. This should significantly boost the solar market going forward. ZPC, the central utility, has plans for a 300MW solar project, which would be the first renewable project in its portfolio, but progress has been slow."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Solar is the most commonly funded form of renewable energy, however overall investment in clean energy is low. Most of the capital for funding renewable development comes from foreign investors, but many are growing wary of risks. Renewable energy investors have asked for policy changes, such as more relaxed licensing rules for small producers. Prior to 2018, all businesses in Zimbabwe were required to be majority owned by a local, which dissuaded foreign participation in the renewable market. Overall economic stability is also a concern. The government outlawed all foreign currency in July 2019 and reintroduced the Zimbabwean dollar as the only form of legal tender. The Zimbabwe dollar was wiped out a decade ago due to hyperinflation and there are worries that this will recur."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"National electricity tariffs are roughly USD$0.0983 per kWh, compared to a regional average of USD $0.14 per kWh, according to ZESA. In reality, Zimbabwe's tariffs are among the highest in the region when accounting for exchange rates.  In April 2019, ZESA applied for a 30% increase in tariffs to fund grid maintenance after the price of inputs such as diesel and coal increased. The national regulator, ZERA, is operating at a loss and ZESA has struggled to collect more than $1 billion owed by defaulters. The government's mandatory rollout of prepaid meters was designed to bring in more stable revenue. According to ZETDC, the program has improved revenue inflows by 35%."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"State-owned ZESA is the holding company for both the national generation utility (ZPC) and the T&D utility (ZETDC). Hydro accounts for about half of Zimbabwe's overall power generation, supplied by the Kariba plant on the Zambezi river. Water levels on the river have been low over the past few years, which has contributed greatly to the country's severe load shedding. The other largest source of generation is coal, which has also been unreliable due to fuel shortage and cost fluctuations. The market for power generation has been liberalized and is open to IPPs. ZERA, the regulatory agency, has issued 30 IPP agreements in the past five years and most are for renewable energy (solar). However, only eight of these are currently operational. Participation by the private sector is still low due to capital constraints. ZESA faces major challenges including validating infrastructure, insufficient foreign currency, power theft, and non-payment of bills. As a result, it is said to be on the brink of collapse."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"On average, the country produces 969MW daily against a peak demand of 2,100MW, resulting in severe load shedding of up to 18 hours per day. Businesses in the country are struggling to maintain operations without stable electricity supply.  Due to unreliable generation in the country's own fleet, Zimbabwe imports around $50 million of electricity each week primarily from South Africa, Mozambique and Zambia. This is not sustainable long-term. All of the country's five main generation plants have surpassed their 25 year general lifespan and are in need of modernization. However, funding for this is limited. In March 2019, Zimbabwe started exporting electricity to regional neighbors including Namibia even while it itself still faced severe load shedding."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act required that at least 51% of shares in any business must be held by indigenous Zimbabweans. This was an impediment to foreign investment. In March 2018, the requirement was removed, and foreigners can now own 100% of a company in Zimbabwe except for platinum and diamond mining companies. This should open the door for more foreign investment. Corruption is a problem and it impedes international investment. A solar plant project that was earmarked to be built in Gwanda stalled after allegations that funds were misappropriated at the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority."}]}
