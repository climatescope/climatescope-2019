energy policy","value":"The Central African Republic has little in the way of implemented or upcoming clean energy policy. Despite the vast majority of electricity generation stemming from small hydro plants, the country has no clean energy targets to supplement or maintain these penetration levels. Additionally, there are no auctions, feed-in tariffs or other incentives. Given the dire security situation in the country, this is not surprising. Officials are keen to develop policies in order to incentivize more independent power producers to become active."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment has neither been a top priority for the state, nor has it been readily available. The majority, if not all, of clean energy financing has come from international development banks and Chinese companies, which are increasingly active in the country. Projects to date have focused on updating the existing infrastructure and generation assets, rather than expanding the fleet of clean energy generators. For instance, the China Gezhouba Group Corporation is involved in modernizing the Boali II hydropower plant, among other projects. This emphasis on upkeep as opposed to new-build is due to the ongoing conflict within CAR, which has destroyed much of the energy infrastructure, in addition to the lack of maintenance by indebted state-owned utility Enerca, as well as the general absence of supporting policies and financial means."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The government artificially keeps power prices low and financially supports the heavily indebted state-owned utility Enerca, which is unable to cover its costs. The utility is currently undergoing a reorganization with the support of the World Bank in order to improve its performance. Technology costs in the country are difficult to determine due to the very low pipeline of any capacity additions. The very few projects that have been announced lack in detail and are currently on hold due to ongoing political disturbances, preventing progress from being made."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Most electricity generation comes from dated small hydro systems, the oldest of which has been operating since the mid-1950s. These systems are poorly maintained and break down often. The national grid only extends to the capital Bangui. There are supplementary diesel-powered generation units, but these are small and only account for a fraction of total power generation. There is an interconnection with the Democratic Republic of Congo, but this is inactive due to degradation. State-owned utility Enerca dominates the generation, distribution and retail of electricity, despite all three segments being liberalized for competition. So far, however, no independent power producers have emerged, likely due to the dire security situation in the country. There are plans to introduce further laws to facilitate competition, but none have yet been made public."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Electricity demand in the Central African Republic has been relatively flat over the past decade. Very little progress has been made in terms of national, urban and rural electrification rates. As distribution grids and electrification rates improve, demand is expected to rise. While there are programs to modernize the energy infrastructure, funded primarily by international development banks, these are not sufficient to enable wider electrification of the population. There is therefore a high potential for mini-grids."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The dire security situation in the Central African Republic significantly inhibits any form of business project. Currently, the majority of the country is controlled by armed groups, with hardly any basic services available for large parts of the population. The risks for developers and asset owners are therefore high. In addition to the lack of stability in the market, the absence of major policies to incentivize clean energy growth, as well as a lack of sufficient finance and infrastructure to facilitate such growth, are key barriers. There are no exemptions for clean energy components or equipment. The government is considering whether to implement such measures, but this is unlikely to happen in the near future."}]}
