energy policy","value":"The government originally set a target of 10% renewable energy generation in Ghana's energy mix by 2020, but it was pushed back to 2030. The current level of renewable energy penetration remains very low and it is unlikely to increase dramatically in the near future. The government that took power in January 2017 reviewed all renewables PPAs approved under the country's feed-in tariff program, and canceled or deferred some of them. This is because Ghana had excess power generation capacity compared to demand, and the government wanted to stop paying for power unnecessarily. The feed-in tariff program exists in theory today, however, it is unlikely developers can access this any longer."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment has stalled over the last couple of years as the government embarked on the PPA review, which delayed most renewables projects. The majority of investment in renewable energy in Ghana has come from foreign sources, with the largest solar project (20MW) financed by Chinese investors. New investments into utility-scale renewables would be limited in the near term as the government is unlikely to approve new projects under the feed-in tariff scheme. On the other hand, the distributed solar sector startups have attracted some investments. These include PEG Africa, a pay-as-you-go solar company, and Redavia, an on-site solar financier and developer."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Ghana has some of the highest power prices in the region, due to an inefficient transmission and distribution system with high losses, PPAs with expensive thermal generation and a failure to effectively collect revenue. As a result, the power prices increased through the mid-2010s, and became one of the main focuses of the 2016 election. In March 2018, the new government cut the electricity tariffs for industrial customers by as much as 30%, and the reductions were also extended further to residential and commercial customers. The new tariffs are not reflective of the cost of generation and transmission, and so are heavily subsidized. Despite the reductions, the tariffs are still one of the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The generation sector has several independent power producers operating plants together with state-owned companies such as Volta River Authority (VRA). State-owned Ghana Grid Co. (Gridco) is the sole company that owns and operates the transmission system. Distribution is carried out by the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG), the Northern Electricity Distribution Co. (Nedco) and Enclave Power Co. ECG had to be rescued through concession by Meralco, the Philippine electricity company. The concession is aimed to turn around the poor finances of ECG and increase investment in the Ghanaian grid. Some 62.5% of generation was sourced from oil and gas in 2018, and 37.2% was from hydro. Renewable energy is largely confined to two utility-scale PV plants, with little prospect of new projects in the near future. On-site solar for commercial, industrial and public premises has been gradually penetrating since 2017."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand in Ghana has been growing, with peak demand reaching 2,525MW in 2018, up by 17% from 2017. The heaviest power consumers are the 51 companies registered as bulk customers (as of August 29, 2019). These entities have a peak demand of at least 500 KVA for a consecutive period of three months or a minimum annual energy consumption of 1GWh. Many of these are concentrated in the Tema Export Processing Zones, which is authorized by the government to promote industrial activities. The extractive industry is also a heavy power consumer, accounting for about 10% of the total power demand in Ghana. The national electrification rate reached 84% in 2018, which is one of the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"In early 2018, the government enacted the Local Content and Local Participation Regulations (LI 2354) for the electricity supply industry, including the renewable energy sector. Non-Ghanaian companies that were already operating since before December 2017 have a grace period of fice years to comply with the rule. Ghana offers import duty and VAT exemption on PV equipment, but it requires PV modules to be packaged together when they are brought into the country. Importers also report that the tax exemptions are not applied consistently. For utility-scale renewables, offtaker risk remains the biggest barrier as the government canceled or deferred approved renewables PPAs in 2018. Amid the oversupply of generation capacity today, Ghana is unlikely support renewables in the near term."}]}
