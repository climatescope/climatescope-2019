energy policy","value":"Cambodia has few clean energy policies in place today, and there are no incentives such as feed-in tariffs or net metering which could support residential or commercial solar. However, the Asian Development Bank has been working with Electricité Du Cambodge (EDC) to help launch a pilot solar auction to procure 100MW. On February 13, 2019, the EDC invited bids for the first leg of the auction: a 60MW project in Kampong Chhnang province. Another 40MW will be tendered in late 2019 or in 2020."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Like its neighbor Laos, Cambodia has directed power sector investment toward large hydro and coal-fired power plants, as well as transmission and distribution, to support its electrification target. Non-hydro renewables investment has been very slow to take off. However, a drought in 2019 that caused wide-spread blackouts for months in a row, made the government change direction. In February 2019, a 100MW solar tender kicked off, and in July 2019 the government approved another 140MW of solar projects, so investment is expected to increase rapidly now. There are few Cambodian banks or other financial institutions with the ability to support renewable energy projects at present, although some small banks, with assistance from Japanese parent companies, are hoping to increase the availability of domestic financing with capacity building."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Cambodia's consumers pay some of the highest retail electricity rates in the region, at $0.15/kWh for most residential consumers. These tariffs have declined by roughly one-third since 2010, as the government has sought to make power more affordable as it connects more villages to the grid. Tariffs are not cost-reflective but are subsidized by the government, which covers losses faced by electricity distributors. Because of the focus on rapid electrification and lowering costs, EDC and the government have favored large power plants with low per-megawatt costs, such as hydro and coal."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Cambodia's power market is dominated by EDC, a utility that controls most of the grid and retails power to all grid-connected consumers. Nearly all of the generators are owned by independent power producers, which are able to sell to EDC only via a special license. In remote areas of the country, electricity is supplied by hundreds of private operators that generate, deliver and sell power. These operators however lose their licenses to generate power as soon as the national grid arrives. Over 90% of grid-supplied power in Cambodia is generated by large hydro and coal-fired plants. Most of these units have been built since 2012, with the overall stock quadrupling as Cambodia sought to wean itself off imports as demand boomed."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"TThe government's aggressive electrification program has raised the share of households with access to electricity from 22% in 2010 to a reported 72% in 2018, boosting demand for power six-fold. The quality of electricity supply remains an issue in remote areas, but opportunities for off-grid companies are thin: the government is not transparent about grid extension plans, and off-grid systems are unable to feed into the grid once it arrives, effectively stranding these assets. Many companies formerly specializing in solar home systems have shifted focus to work on commercial and industrial sites, where there is more opportunity."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The absence of clear regulations makes it very hard for solar developers to connect rooftop projects to the grid. Without any regulations on net metering, feed-in tariffs or export tariffs, only behind-the-meter projects with a 100% self-consumption are possible. There is a hesitance to move forward with appropriate policy measures on EDC's side as the grid itself is old and not smart, and probably cannot handle a large number of intermittent small-scale resources. For utility-scale renewables, it can be difficult to obtain a generation license, which is required to export power to the grid."}]}
