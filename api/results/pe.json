Since then, four auctions have been carried out, resulting in 71 project developments totaling 1.34 GW of biomass, small hydro, solar and wind. Peru also offers priority dispatch to clean energy plants and 20% accelerated depreciation for renewables projects.\nPeru held an auction for off-grid solar in November 2014 to contract up to 500,000 off-grid PV systems. Ergon, the only winner, announced that will develop 150,000-200,000 systems by 2034, when the investment contract expires. As of July 2019, Ergon had commissioned nearly 134,000 systems.

Most of the investments were in small hydro and onshore wind projects, equivalent to 39% and 32%, respectively, of the total. However, from 2016 to 2018, solar attracted most investment, registering $300 million in the period, compared to $200 million in wind. \n\nPeru saw a peak in investment throughout 2012-2014, mostly led by financing of auction projects. In recent years, clean energy investment in the country has faded, as only $300 million was invested in 2017 and less than $2 million in 2018. The country has received capital from international and national commercial financial institutions, as well as development banks. The biggest lead arrangers are U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and European Investment Bank, registering $235 and $213 million on PV and onshore wind."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"From 2016 to 2018, power prices in Peru rose an average of 10%.

Commercial and residential rates were respectively $106.40/MWh and $137.57/MWh in 2016, rising to $117.95/MWh and $150.14/MWh in 2018.

That source accounted for 51% in 2018, up from 40% in 2016, despite no significant capacity additions. Regarding non-renewable sources, coal and oil saw shrinkage in generation. Coal was responsible for generating only 43GWh in 2018 compared to 674GWh in 2017; oil declined 71% in the same period. \n\nPeru's installed hydro (small and large), solar, wind and biomass accounts for 43% of the country's 13,052MW of generating capacity. In 2018, 585MW of small hydro was commissioned compared to 472MW in 2017.

A renewable auction expected to be held in 2018 was canceled in April 2017, and no new tender has been announced. MINEM's explanation for the cancellation is that not all projects selected in the previous auction are being developed.\n\nIn 10 years, Peru saw its electrification rate spike from 74% to 96%, the biggest increase in Latin America. The progress is due to a rural electrification program, which included an off-grid auction aiming to contract PV systems for isolated regions in the country."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Peru's energy consumption has been stable, with an average of 1% increase in demand over the past two years.
