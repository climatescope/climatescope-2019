energy policy","value":"Uruguay is the Latin American country with the highest penetration of clean energy generation. In 2018, 36% of the total power produced in the country came from wind and solar plants. This is a result of strong clean energy policies and the launch of the National Energy Plan, which established that 15% of the country's energy supply should come from renewable sources by 2015. Furthermore, the plan mandates the addition of 300MW of wind capacity and 200MW of biomass to the national grid by the same year. The goal was achieved one year before the target date and in 2015 the country had 857MW of wind and 425MW of biomass installed. In 2018, Uruguay's proportion of clean energy on the national grid was of 44%, excluding large hydro."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Between 2011 and 2018, Uruguay received $4.5 billion in clean energy investment from national and international commercial banks and international development banks. The lead arrangers are Inter-American Development Bank and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW). In 2015, the country registered the highest annual investment, $1.2 billion. Over 90% of the total was directed to wind plants. In 2018, investments in renewables hit record low levels for the period, with just $5 million directed to clean energy projects."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"As Uruguay is heavily dependent on hydropower, auctions have been a key mechanism to diversify the power matrix. From 2009 to 2016, the country contracted over 300MW of wind through auctions. As a result, wind generation jumped 32 times, from 144GWh in 2013 to 4,732GWh in 2018. However, due to the increase of intermittent generation combined with level demand, the country is starting to have curtailment issues."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Uruguay's electricity market is overseen by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines. The vertically integrated utility company UTE (Administración Nacional de Usinas y Transmisiones Eléctricas) controls part of the generation market and 100% of transmission and distribution. UTE allows the participation of independent power producers through auctions, usually for 20-year power purchase agreements (PPA)."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Uruguay's clean energy sector boomed between 2011 and 2015, as result of the energy target and incentive policies for renewable energy. However, the spike in power generation from intermittent sources has saturated the market. As a result, investment has declined and the country is unlikely to hold new clean energy auctions in the short term."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The main barrier for Uruguayan clean development is the lack of demand growth. The country has deployed a significant amount of new generation relatively to its small market, and there is little room for more additions. In 2017, curtailment began with hydro and private wind plants. These plants were forced to stop generation, meaning a waste of $59 million in payments due to wind electricity generated and not consumed and UTE's obligation of buying all energy delivered on its grid."}]}
