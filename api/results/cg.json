energy policy","value":"The Republic of the Congo has little to offer in terms of clean energy policy. The country has neither implemented legislation intended to incentivize the development of renewable energy projects, nor set a specific target that it seeks to achieve. The policy agenda is focused upon managing the emergence of a new state utility and maximizing the country's large hydro potential, while clean energy is pushed to the margins."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Renewable energy investments in the Congo remain few and far between. China Gezhouba Group and Sinohydro have been investing in hydropower projects, such as the 19.5MW Liouesso plant, as well as two prospective major dams in Sounda and Chollet. However, the plants have run into environmental and technical issues, making their future unclear. Finance for potential renewables initiatives would likely come from international donors, such as the French Development Agency, the African Development Bank and the World Bank, which have been involved with rural electrification projects in the country."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail power prices are much lower than in neighboring Cameroon and the Central African Republic, and cheap when compared to the region as a whole. There is no differentiation between commercial, industrial and residential prices, and the only variation is by consumption band. Tariffs have been fixed since 1994 and are kept well below production costs through significant subsidies. Prices are unlikely to be increased in the near future, following the successful relaunch of recently-privatized state utility E2C."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Thermal power constitutes just over half of installed capacity in Congo, primarily provided by a 300MW gas plant in Pointe Noire owned by Italian developer Eni and the Congolese state. Large hydro also accounts for a sizeable slice of generation through the Imboulou (120MW) and Moukoukoulou (74MW) dams. No non-hydro renewables capacity has been installed to date, with new projects in the pipeline exclusively comprising large hydro projects or the expansion of the Pointe Noire gas plant. The four segments of the power sector are dominated by private utility E2C (Energie Electrique du Congo), which was a public enterprise running by the name of Societe Nationale d'Electricite until June 2018. Power generation was opened up to private power producers in 2003, but regulations concerning private generation still remain unclear, with the only semi-independent power producer to date being Eni's gas plant. The plant's power purchase agreement must be renegotiated following the change in E2C's legal status."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The Republic of Congo has been teetering on the brink of insolvency since 2016 in the context of an economic crisis sparked by plummeting oil prices. The country's business environment has been detrimentally impacted and has also contributed to reducing the market's attractiveness. Moreover, finance to date has been directed toward large hydro projects rather than other renewables. The National Agency for Rural Electrification and the Fund for the Development of the Power Sector lack the financial means necessary to abate low electrification rates. Investment in the country's decrepit dams is lacking, with no concerted modernization plan in place to date."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The privatization of the former public utility SNE has caused upheaval in the power sector, sowing confusion with regards to the assets owned by E2C and the general functioning of the new private utility. Offtaker risk was already high when SNE was a public entity, so it is unclear how reliable the newly privatized E2C will be. In addition, following the issuance of the 2019 finance law, obtaining a generation licence now amounts to five million central African francs per megawatt installed ($9,000 per MW as per average 2018 conversion rate), which is a prohibitively high cost for developers. Fixed electricity tariffs that do not cover production costs further aggravate the issue of project viability. Finally, equipment required for renewable energy projects is taxable through both import tariffs and VAT ' increasing capital costs."}]}
