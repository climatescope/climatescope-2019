energy policy","value":"The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) had its first democratic transfer of power since independence in January 2019 after a controversial election held in December 2018. The election saw President Felix Tshisekedi emerge as the winner. Although he won the popular vote, his party failed to win a majority in the National Assembly and Senate, leaving it under the control of former president Joseph Kabila's FCC party. On August 20 to 22, 2019, the president held the country's first electricity forum to source inputs into the country's energy policy and strategy. The key focus of the government is increasing accessibility to electricity to about 30% by 2030.  The DRC's low energy requirement and dependence on hydropower is not conducive to the development of clean-energy policy to encourage renewables build. Tax incentives for renewable energy projects are the sole area where policy directly benefits the industry."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investment in clean energy projects in the DRC has been limited for a number of reasons. The lack of a proper legal instrument to define the energy sector discourages investors from funding new projects. In addition, the dominance of the highly subsidized, state-backed company, SNEL, in the generation, transmission and distribution of power make the investment climate less competitive. The absence of government regulation and energy policy on renewable energy does not encourage long-term capital investment in the renewable energy sector. Hydropower remains the dominant form of energy generation, given the country's significant river resources ' notably the Congo River. The few announced solar projects are small-scale and linked to commercial mining activities or the telecoms industry."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The DRC has a regulated electricity tariff that has only marginally changed over the last few years. Residential customers are charged one of the lowest tariffs in the world, which does not even cover the operating costs of the utility, SNEL. However, there have been recent increases to residential tariffs due to a devaluation in the Congolese franc, according to reports. There has been little change to the levelized costs of electricity in the DRC due to a lack of new projects being built in the last 36 years and poor maintenance of existing energy infrastructure. Electricity is mostly purchased by consumers for a fixed lump sum as meters are very scarce, leaving much of the billing at the discretion of officials. Furthermore, it is also common for public institutions (schools, health centers and public enterprises) to have large amounts overdue on their electricity bills."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Hydropower supplies the vast majority of the DRC's electricity needs and the Congo River has significant potential for further dam development. As yet, there are no utility-scale wind and solar projects, although there is some evidence this could change: Copperbelt Energy has announced plans for two PV plants to feed electricity to copper and cobalt mines in the country. Volt renewable energy has also announced a 500MW solar development project with the SNEL, the national utility provider. Power generation still largely rests in the hands of state-controlled utility SNEL, which owns and operates 94% of installed capacity in the DRC. Independent power producers own just 6% of total generating capacity, at 135MW, which is mostly used for mining activities."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Mining activity will drive near-term growth in power demand in the DRC, in part due to the increase in global demand for specialty metals such as copper and cobalt, which the country has in abundant supply. Copperbelt Energy's plans to build two grid-connected solar PV projects for the mining sector are evidence of this. The government plans to triple the current national electrification rate to 32% by 2030 and this is likely to mean favorable policies will be introduced for mini-grids or off-grid solar. Most DRC power plants are hydroelectric stations that do not require near-term upgrades."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Offtaker risk for power projects in the DRC is very high as SNEL, the state-owned utility, is not solvent. SNEL owns 94% of total installed capacity. This means the prospects for wind and solar developers to build new projects in the country are not very good, due to the high offtaker risk, pricing, currency volatility and political uncertainty. Additionally, poor energy infrastructure, particularly in the area of power transmission and distribution systems, makes it difficult for new entrants to scale up power production across a wider network. The DRC does not yet have any meaningful renewable energy incentives in place. Given the lack of utility-scale energy projects built in recent years, developers would also face a substantial amount of red tape. The DRC has no manufacturing capacity of any scale for its hydro or other renewable energy projects, so local content requirements do not exist. Smaller-scale companies also face import duties on off-grid solar products, unless they are granted an exemption."}]}
