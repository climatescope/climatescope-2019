energy policy","value":"Mali has several clean energy policies in place ' making it further advanced than some neighboring countries. As part of its National Action Plan for Renewable Energy, it aims to increase the share of renewable installed capacity, including medium and large hydro, to 59.25% by 2020. Clean energy currently accounts for one quarter of Mali's total installed capacity, so the country has a way to go to achieve its target, especially given the dominance of hydropower. Mali also offers exemptions on import duties and VAT for solar equipment. A stand-alone feature in the region, the rural electrification fund subsidizes investments in off-grid projects by up to 80% for projects valued at a maximum of $500,000, which is a key factor in boosting Mali's vibrant off-grid market. The subsidies should theoretically incentivize the development of capital-intensive technologies such as solar, but most operators have been relying on diesel so far. Solar-diesel hybrid projects are however becoming more popular."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Most clean energy investments in Mali are international and concessional in nature, with a focus on off-grid projects. For example, the World Bank's hybridization program from 2014 to 2020 has a budget of $44 million, and a $19 million hybridization project by the Abu Dhabi Fund has been launched from 2015 to 2021. Moreover, the Islamic Development Bank in conjunction with Morocco's l'Office National de l'Electricité et de l'Eau Potable is building two solar plants with a capacity of 1.3MW and 1.5MW respectively. In early-2019, the Green Climate Fund and West African Development Bank announced a 4.83MW solar mini-grid project, which they are supporting with $38.9 million. In the case of Akuo's 50MW Kita solar project, a domestic commercial bank, Banque Nationale de Developpment Agricole du Mali, was involved in its financing, but this is the only case of commercial finance to date."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices are subsidized and have remained relatively stable for the past decade, yet are steadily increasing. The average electricity tariff was $0.18/kWh in 2018, which is particularly high compared to neighboring countries. This is likely in part due to costly fossil fuel imports. The state utility EDM runs at a loss, despite being supported by the Malian government. In contrast, the tariffs offered by independent power producers are cost-reflective at around triple the price offered by EDM, causing discontent and limited uptake by customers."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Just under half of Mali's power generation runs on fossil fuels and the remainder is supplied by hydropower. All segments of the power market have been liberalized since 2000, yet EDM dominates generation, transmission, distribution and retail. In rural areas, authorized mini-grid operators can sell power. Most of this capacity is fossil-heavy, but there is an increasing number of hybrid projects. While tendering processes are yet to be standardized, the first clean energy projects have been awarded successfully. In 2015, the government issued two PV tenders for the development of a 25MW project in Koutiala and a 50MW in Sikasso. In August 2019, the rural electrification agency announced a tender for two solar PV plants totaling 1.3MW, in addition to a 1.5MW energy storage system."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand increased annually by more than 8% on average between 2009 and 2018 in Mali. Given that under 40% of the population has access to electricity ' with rates as low as 19% in rural areas ' opportunities for mini-grid developers in particular are high. Solar/diesel hybrid plants are also growing in popularity due to the country's high potential in solar irradiation and its rural electrification fund. The rural electrification agency is responsible for authorizing such operators, making the process of setting up a mini-grid more efficient than in neighboring countries."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Developing clean energy projects in Mali is inhibited mostly by the fragile security situation, with multiple ongoing conflicts within the country. The country's clean energy incentives are also not always consistently applied, even if they offer comparatively more than neighboring countries. The regulatory framework more clearly sets out the roles of the state utility and rural electrification agency than in most other parts of the region, but a certain lack of transparency remains. For example, there have been instances in which privately developed mini-grids were ad hoc appropriated by the state, leading to sunk costs and frustration for investors."}]}
