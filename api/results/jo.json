energy policy","value":"Jordan's National Energy Strategy plan aims for the country to generate 10% of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2020. Since launching, the plan has already seen 1,328MW of renewable projects come into operation, 636MW of which in 1H 2019. Following the completion of a third auction round in October 2018, the government suspended the program to give time to National Electric Power Co. (Nepco) to complete a new power sector plan reviewing the technical feasibility of integrating a larger share of renewables. Despite this temporary freeze linked to grid capacity constraints and the introduction of a 35% local content requirement in round three, stable policies and transparent incentives have allowed Jordan to become a regional leader in renewable energy."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Wind and solar have been the focus of renewable investment to date, with $1.6 billion of utility-scale solar and $1.1 billion of wind financed as of 1H 2019. The government launched a 30MW battery-storage project and targeted a further 70MW of battery-storage capacity pending the outcome of the first project. Traditionally, international development banks have provided financing for renewable projects, however, an increasing number of domestic banks and private equity funds are active in the market. As such, financing for renewable projects in Jordan is well established, and the process of securing finance is less onerous than elsewhere in the region."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Prices for consumers in Jordan are subsidized. Commercial consumers have traditionally paid the highest electricity prices, subsidizing residential consumers. This led to a rise in behind-the-meter projects, with 415MW of small-scale solar installed as of 2019. Wheeling projects have been discouraged slightly through lower prices set for commercial consumers. These changes have not stemmed financial losses at state-owned National Electric Power Co., which is already heavily indebted, and electricity prices across sectors are expected to continue to rise."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The share of renewables in generation increased rapidly from less than 1% in 2010 to just over 9% in 2018, bringing the target of 10% by 2020 well within reach. Capacity additions will slow down in the coming years as the government has suspended auctions until state-owned Nepco completes a new energy-sector development plan. Distinct bodies exist in the sector for production, transmission and distribution. There are separate companies for generation and distribution, while transmission is the responsibility of Nepco. There is no wholesale generation market, and Nepco purchases all generated electricity. Nepco has a template wind and solar PPA that currently exposes them to energy compensation. Jordanian power prices are not market-driven as generators cannot sell directly to the distributors and the government subsidizes tariffs."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The government continues to foresee a considerable increase in power demand despite a slowdown over 2016-2018 linked to slower economic growth. The government expects high population growth combined with an expanding commercial and industrial sector to boost power demand to over 5.8GW by 2025, from 3.3GW in 2017. The majority of Jordanians live in the north of the country surrounding the capital Amman, and 99.9% of the population have access to power. Further renewables growth will be challenged by the financial commitments Nepco has with fossil fuel generators. Whilst growing renewable generation is reducing fossil fuel power plant run hours, Nepco is still bound to pay fossil fuel generators in full through take-or-pay PPAs."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Jordan introduced a 35% local content requirement for solar and wind projects in 2018. The requirement applies to the total value of each project. The solar sector in Jordan is well established, with multiple local firms capable of producing panels, cables and steel structures for solar projects. However, wind projects are likely to struggle to meet the 35% threshold, as there are no major component manufacturers in Jordan. All equipment used in renewable energy projects are exempt from import and sales tax. The National Energy Strategy also provides a 100% exemption from income tax over 10 years for independent power producers generating renewable energy."}]}
