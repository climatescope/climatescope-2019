energy policy","value":"Energy reforms in Mexico that have transformed the power sector have also included strong support for renewable energy. Mexico in 2012 established a mandate to generate 35% of power from clean sources by 2024. It set up a Clean Energy Certificates (CEL) market in 2014, the main incentive for clean energy. The clean energy target began at 5% in 2018 and will increase gradually to 13.9% in 2022.\nImplementation of key policies remains a work in progress. Competition in the qualified supply and wholesale markets is in its infancy. The CEL market only entered into force in 2018, posting supply far below mandated levels. Certificate market demand, essentially a proxy for the total GWh of renewable power that will need to be delivered for Mexico to meet its clean energy goals, is expected to total approximately 13.7 million CELs in 2018, rising to 16.5 million in 2019 and 21.4 million in 2020, according to projections from the Secretariat of Energy (SENER). \nAfter three successful long term renewables auctions over 2016-17 featuring record low prices and contracting a total of 19.8TWh of clean power, 1.8GW of firm capacity, and 20.6 million CELs, President Lopez Obrador canceled Mexico's fourth long-term clean power auction in January 2019. While the new president's electricity plan shows support for renewables in general, his election has cast uncertainty over the sector."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"A substantial increase in opportunities brought about by energy reform transformed Mexico into a leading destination for clean energy investment under the previous administration. Plans to strengthen state control under Lopez Obrador, potentially at the expense of the private sector, are forcing a change of course, Mexico continues to see substantial development activity. The second largest power market in Latin America, Mexico's installed renewables capacity represents 11% of its 77GW total. This share is expected to increase as a result of new investment in the country's excellent solar and wind resources, though the future of auction mechanisms put in place by energy reform is in question. Mexico's financing landscape is diverse, with project developers, commercial banks and development banks all playing important roles. Wind projects, in particular, have been successful in attracting investment. The cost of wind and solar has declined rapidly in recent years, a trend that is expected to continue and which will pressure the country's natural gas sector."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Residential power prices rose in 2018, but historically Mexican consumers have enjoyed among the lowest subsidized rates in the region. Mexico's reserve margin, which is about 6% and has been falling in recent years, and rising load growth, which was 2.9% year-on-year in 2018, are expected to offset planned capacity additions and so keep prices high. The Mexican market is also characterized by relatively high wholesale prices overall, with both day-ahead and real-time prices rising steadily. \nPower in Mexico remains heavily weighted towards fossil fuels, with natural gas, oil and coal together accounting for over 70% of total installed capacity in 2018. Rising prices in the wholesale market attest to the role played by costly thermal generation, with a growing reliance on expensive fuel oil and imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the U.S. Off-takers with a load center of at least 1MW are classified as 'qualified users' and are allowed to purchase electricity directly from qualified suppliers. There are now six such qualified suppliers active in the wholesale market, including CFE Calificados, the subsidiary of state power utility Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE). CFE continues to be the supplier of basic retail services to residential customers and small and medium-sized commercial customers under regulated tariffs. Regulator CRE sets the final retail and last-resort supply tariffs based on the cost of energy and ancillary services required."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Mexico's generation matrix is dominated by thermal sources, which represented approximately 81% of total generation in 2018, primarily natural gas and diesel. Hydro accounted for approximately 10% of generation, followed by nuclear and wind at 3% each. At year-end 2018, Mexico had 4.5GW of wind capacity commissioned, by far the largest renewable technology excluding large hydro. Solar commissioned capacity grew significantly in 2018 to 1.3GW from 344MW in 2017. Mexico is expected to undergo a solar boom through 2020, with over 6GW of utility-scale PV added to the grid in addition to 3GW of wind. \nA fundamental change introduced by Mexico's energy reform is the separation of state-owned vertically integrated utility CFE, which holds the majority of generation assets and retains monopoly over transmission and distribution. Grid operation moved from within CFE to newly created, independent grid operator CENACE, which is to guarantee open and non-discriminatory access to transmission. Deregulation of generation in 2016 created Mexico's wholesale market, which has operated on a day-ahead basis since January 2016, with a real-time spot market beginning in January 2017."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"After improving under the previous administration, business opportunities for renewable energy in Mexico have begun to encounter increased uncertainties, with the election of President Lopez Obrador in 2018 clouding the outlook for what has recently been Latin America's hottest renewable energy market. The cancellation of Mexico's auctions upended the renewables industry, but fundamentals remain strong. \nMexico's national generation expanded by over 4% per year over the past five years. The country's three auctions held over 2016-17 spurred investor interest in the country's excellent wind and solar resources, and Mexico has led Latin America in new clean energy investment since 2017. Large projects that secured contracts in the country's first auction, held in March 2016, began to come online in 2018. \nIn June 2018, Mexico announced the end of the 15% customs duty on solar PV module imports, introduced in 2015, removing a significant barrier to renewables development. Mexico is a potential market for distributed generation, with residential PV installation accelerating rapidly in recent years. Retail electricity consumers in Mexico who have renewable energy or cogeneration facilities can connect to the national grid, deliver surplus generation to it, and obtain billing credit for excess electricity provided."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"While Mexico's energy reform has increased private participation in generation, the market remains highly concentrated in the hands of CFE, the state-owned, formerly vertically integrated utility. New plans to strengthen state control under Lopez Obrador raise questions around the durability of key elements of reform. Diversification of certain areas of the competitive landscape, such as in qualified supply, remains a work in progress. Investors are also wary of environmental and other risks in some areas of Mexico due to land disputes with indigenous communities, which remain an important barrier for project development in the country and a primary reason for project delays in specific regions, such as Yucatan. Additionally, there remains uncertainty around the CEL market and in particular, whether there will be sufficient clean energy capacity to generate quantities of CELs needed to comply with future requirements."}]}
