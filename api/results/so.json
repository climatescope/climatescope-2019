energy policy","value":"Somalia's power sector is severely under-developed due to years of conflict and political instability. Most electricity in urban areas is supplied by localized, privately-run mini-grids. Local independent electricity service providers typically own both power generation and power transmission infrastructure. The country's relatively small 100MW installed base consists primarily of diesel generators and in most cases, consumers buy directly from the mini-grid at high prices. The country is divided into regions with no central administration overseeing the energy sector, while the self-declared independent Somaliland has its own energy ministry. Consolidation is occurring among many independent power producers but there is a concerning lack of regulation around this. Many international organizations, including the World Bank and USAID, are active in Somalia and are working to help establish a regulatory framework to incentivize additional investment in electricity infrastructure."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Somalia owes significant debt to a number of international financial institutions, making it ineligible for international development aid and concessional financing from many other sources. Most international power sector investment in Somalia comes through short- and medium-term grants. A number of international organizations are undertaking large-scale projects focused on the power sector and energy security. Somalia also receives significant remissions from its diaspora, and in some cases, power producers can fund projects directly through this kind of investment."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail power prices in Somalia are among the highest in Africa because electricity service providers still rely primarily on inefficient diesel generators with high fuel costs. Transmission infrastructure is fragmented and unreliable, and losses are high at around 40% compared to the sub-Saharan Africa average of 11%. Power grids are usually localized, which increases costs and prevents companies from realizing economies of scale. Finally, metering infrastructure and consumer rates are inadequate enough to incentivize efficient electricity use. Many electricity providers charge based on the number of appliances or light bulbs used, giving consumers little reason to use more efficient devices or to curb their consumption."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The population of Somalia relies on traditional biomass for its basic energy needs due to an unreliable power supply. Electricity suppliers that do operate mostly run on diesel generators, although PV systems are starting to penetrate the market, mainly in Somaliland. The initial investment required for a diesel generator is still lower in some cases than a PV system, so adding PV to an existing diesel system is proving popular among small IPPs. Many electricity service providers operating in Somaliland have specific plans to add renewables to their existing diesel infrastructure."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The absence of reliable electricity supply is in general a major concern for Somalia and a significant barrier to doing business. Even consumers that do have a grid connection are dissatisfied with the quality of the power they receive. Were generation capacity and transmission and distribution infrastructure to improve, power demand could grow significantly. The grid in Somalia is already very decentralized, so off-grid and mini-grid development offers the potential for electrification even in the most remote areas. Somalia's rich solar resources make PV mini-grid systems an attractive option, and its long coastline also offers good resource potential for wind."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Somalia's electricity sector remains almost entirely unregulated, so private power producers can enter the market without needing to compete with a national monopoly. However, the lack of national transmission or distribution infrastructure is a major barrier to developing grid-connected projects. The local workforce also lacks in technical expertise and even construction equipment is in many cases difficult to secure. Although Somaliland is more stable, the security situation in other areas is also a deterrent to investors and makes it difficult to achieve financing."}]}
