energy policy","value":"Tanzania's energy policy is underpinned by three targets: 2021 goals for 4,915MW of power generating capacity and a 50% renewables generation mix, and a 75% electrification target in 2025. However, since setting these targets in 2016, Tanzania's installed capacity has increased to just 1,461MW, fossil fuels still make up 60% of generating capacity and the country has a 33% electrification rate. Two tenders announced in September 2018 for 150MW of solar and 200MW of wind would have gone a long way in reaching both targets, but both were canceled. The country has a standardized power purchase agreement structure for projects smaller than 10MW ' this will need to be adapted to large-scale projects in order for Tanzania to come close to reaching its targets."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Like many Sub-Saharan African countries with inconsistent clean energy build, investment in Tanzania's clean energy space is sporadic. There is a healthy presence of international donor agencies like USAID, the World Bank and the African Development Bank, along with a number of domestic and international commercial banks. However, the Tanzania Electricity Supply Company (TANESCO) is an unreliable offtaker, sometimes compensating counterparties months late, and the government continues to support fossil fuel development and large hydro, such as the 2.1GW Stiegler's Gorge hydro project that is under development. So long as these two factors remain constant, renewables investment in Tanzania will continue to limp along."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail electricity prices in Tanzania have remained lower than many other East African countries, averaging close to $0.09/kWh in 2018, and are regulated by the Energy and Water Utilities Authority. Prices are low partially due to the near-600MW of installed hydro capacity, but also due to heavy subsidization from Tanzania's Ministry of Energy, which is intended to attract industrialization in the country. In February 2016, TANESCO, the state-owned utility, lobbied for slightly lower retail prices to help the country reach its 75% electrification target in 2025 without jeopardizing its profitability, but prices have overall remained relatively stable."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"On-grid, Tanzania has a diverse, albeit dirty, power generation portfolio, consisting of thermal generation like natural gas (632MW) and diesel (231MW), but also large hydro (568MW), small hydro (19MW) and biomass (11MW). Capacity has increased at a snail's pace, with only 15MW of new on-grid capacity commissioned since 2016. There are a number of independent power producers selling power to TANESCO under power purchase agreements, but TANESCO still owns over 50% of the country's generation. The country's Ministry of Energy has plans to establish a competitive wholesale and retail electricity market in 2025, but this remains little more than ambition at this stage."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Doing business in Tanzania's clean energy sector presents risk. The country's power demand has failed to grow with the country's population, and the regulator published data showing that power demand actually fell between 2017 and 2018. Additionally, there are questions surrounding the validity of economic growth figures the country has published, which is expected to fuel more investor uncertainty. The country has significant potential for solar and hydro, but neither technology has been fully realized. Through 2018, off-grid solar accounts for just 1.7% of lighting supply in rural Tanzania and 1% in urban areas. A number of multinational off-grid solar players like Zola Electric and Mobisol have operations in the country, but a dominant player has not emerged."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"TANESCO is an unreliable offtaker, a situation at least in part driven by cheap retail electricity prices that compromise its profitability. Many independent power producers operating in Tanzania have suffered from late payments from the utility, and there is little indication that TANESCO is working to amend this situation ' in 2016 it lobbied for cheaper retail electricity to boost the country's power demand, further weakening its profitability. Another challenge is the enforcement of a value-added tax exemption for off-grid solar products. Many importers and distributors have been penalized due to unfamiliarity from tax officers, in general prohibiting the off-grid market in Tanzania from realizing its true potential."}]}
