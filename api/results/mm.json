The LCOE of solar and wind in Southeast Asia (Thailand as a benchmark) is still two to three times higher than of the U.S. or China.

Renewable energy is getting traction, with the country's first utility-scale solar plant of 40MW coming online in May 2019, and another 460MW of solar and wind projects announced or under construction. Although the country's power market is still dominated by a few state owned players, it is starting to open up power generation to foreign players. Sembcorp Power, a Singaporean utility, became the first foreign independent power producer in Myanmar this year, while a few Chinese and European players are negotiating with the government to develop solar, wind and microgrid projects in the country."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Myanmar will need to increase its power capacity fourfold by 2030 from the 2017 level to meet its demand and the target of 100% electrification. In addition to developing utility scale gas plants and renewable power, the government has ambitious plan to build microgrid and offgrid projects across the country, with funding from multilateral development agencies."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The major barriers for clean energy development include uncertainty in policy as well as political and offtaker risks. There are no official feed-in tariff or auction policies to support renewable power. All the projects are subject to negotiation with the government in a non-transparent manner. Many large-scale hydro projects are held back because of local NGO protests and domestic military conflicts, and this might impact future development of large scale wind projects as well. As the market is not yet liberalized, it is not clear if the state owned grid companies are willing to keep to the terms of the power purchase agreements."}]}
