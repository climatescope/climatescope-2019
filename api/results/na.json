energy policy","value":"In 2015, Namibia introduced its feed-in tariff program (Refit), which opened up its previously vertically integrated power sector to privately owned renewables projects. Under Refit, Nampower (Namibia's state-owned utility) has signed contracts for 70MW of solar capacity between 14 counterparties. As of 2019, 45MW of the 70MW contracted have been commissioned. \nNambia's power sector regulator has suggested that it would stop awarding Refit contracts, and instead switch to tenders to procure additional capacity.\nTwo renewable projects totaling 41MW have been awarded through tenders to date. Five unsolicited independent power producers (IPPs) have signed PPAs with Nampower.\nIn its 2019-2023 business plan, Nampower pledged to spend an additional $338 million to add 220MW of renewable power to the grid, and another 70MW that will be procured from IPPs. This would represent a 50% increase in Namibia's installed capacity."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Solar PV is proliferating at a very rapid pace in Namibia, having roughly doubled its capacity each year between 2014 and 2018. Solar PV currently represents 13% of installed capacity. Solar PV's relatively low cost and high capacity factors have meant it has eclipsed investment in the wind fleet, which is comprised of two projects to date.\nMost of the equity investment in energy projects built after 2015 has been put up by foreign companies such as Spanish IPP Alten Energias Renovables and Canadian Solar. Pipeline projects are owned by other international stakeholders such as EDF and Innosun. \nThe government recently introduced ownership share rules that limit foreign equity ownership. For example, to qualify for Refit, each project has to allocate at least 30% ownership to disadvantaged local groups.\nDebt has been provided by local Namibian banks as well as a diverse set of international development banks such as the African Development Bank, France's Association of Fundraising Professionals, and the Green Climate Fund."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Unlike many of its neighbors, retail power prices in Namibia are cost reflective and unsubsidized. Therefore, their prices are among the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, and have increased above 5% annually for the last six years. Retail tariffs vary by season and time of use (peak versus non-peak), and contain high capacity charges for industrial and commercial consumers. These retail-rate structures are prime for battery development, which could reduce a site's peak load and shift consumption from high-priced to low-priced times of the day.\nThe country is burdened by its inability to meet demand with domestic power. About 60% of electricity needs are met with electricity imports from South Africa, the costs of which are substantially higher than power from local plants.\nHigh electricity prices are driving investments in off-grid solar-plus-battery systems, even in areas where the grid is available. Windhoek, the capital of Namibia, alone has an estimated 20MW of off-grid capacity. \nWhile the country has done much to incentivize solar generation, which will help provide electricity at midday, the country lacks highly flexible generation sources that would help minimize electricity imports during the most costly peak hours."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The Ruacana hydro plant dominates Namibia's power fleet, accounting for 58% of installed capacity. Namibia has some of the strongest solar resources in the world, thanks to its proximity to the equator and its arid climate.  Single-axis tracking solar PV projects have achieved an annual capacity factor of over 30.2%. High capacity factors and advances in solar technology have contributed to a swift decline in the levelized cost of solar. BloombergNEF's levelized cost estimates suggest they have halved for solar in sub-Saharan Africa between 2015 and 2019 (from $107/MWh to $53/MWh).\nLow costs and high output have contributed to Solar PV's rapid growth in Namibia, which has seen a doubling of solar capacity each year between 2014 and 2018. Solar PV currently represents 13% of installed capacity.\nAt the moment, Nampower is the only offtaker with which IPPs can sign PPAs. However, the Electricity Control Board, the regulator, wants to switch from a single buyer model to a modified single buyer model, where IPPs can sell directly to local distributors and large consumers, and potentially also export power."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Namibia experienced an economic recession between 2016 and 1Q 2019. As of the second quarter of 2019, the economy showed some signs of growth. Fitch ratings agency expects 1.1% real GDP growth in 2019. \nIn spite of the weak economic backdrop, power demand in Namibia has increased year-over-year at an average rate of 4% since 2006. The main factor propping up demand growth is a rapidly increasing electrification rate, which now sits at 54%. Rural electricity access still lags significantly, and is over 20% below the national average. \nThe country has an ambitious rural electrification target, aiming for 50% electricity access by 2020. Large investments in off-grid systems and mini-grids will be necessary to meet that goal. Providing access to the rural population has historically been a challenge in Namibia, as it is the least densely populated country in Africa and the rural population is extremely dispersed. \nIn some areas, grid extensions are not financially feasible. So far, minigrids have been developed top-down by the government, but they are keen to discuss public-private partnership arrangements with investors."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Infrastructure limitations pose the biggest challenge for capacity additions, especially for projects over 30MW in size. Nampower recently announced that the transmission system is reaching the limits of how much intermittent generation it can sustain. The transmission system frequently experiences congestion. A new transmission line is currently under construction. No smart-grid management systems are in place, which would help with increasing intermittent generation. \nThere are no local content requirements for renewable energy developers, as Namibia does not have a manufacturing industry. \nHowever, the government introduced ownership share rules that limit the share of foreign equity investment. To be eligible for the feed-in tariff program, projects need to allocate at least 30% of the ownership to local disadvantaged groups."}]}
