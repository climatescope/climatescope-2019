energy policy","value":"Mozambique has taken early steps toward development of clean energy alongside ample donor support. A lack of regulatory clarity and follow-through, however, as well as competing priorities, continue to restrain development. Longer-term priorities include several large hydroelectric power projects, such as the 1,500MW Mphanda Nkuwa dam. Still, near-term efforts are focused on natural gas and coal-fired generation facilities, as well as two solar projects, one of which was commissioned in July 2019. Scatec's 40MW Mocuba PV Plant is Mozambique's first utility-scale solar project. A second, Neoen's 40MW Metoro PV Plant, remains under development. Mozambique created its renewable energy feed-in tariff (Refit) in 2014, intended to apply to PV, wind, biomass and small hydro projects from 10 kW to 10MW. However, the scheme has not come into force and there are no permitted tariffs for off-grid projects. There are no auctions in Mozambique currently, but there is a program that is under development, Proler, that aims to launch four pilot tenders by 2021, three for solar and one for wind, of 30-50MW each."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Mozambique has historically relied heavily on its large-hydro resources, with the broader power fleet seeing little investment over recent years. More recently, investment has been directed to developing the domestic natural gas sector, which has grown rapidly since 2015. In terms of clean technology, the last decade saw Mozambique receive limited investment in biofuels and small, but growing inflows into solar. Only international and national development organizations have financed Mozambique's clean energy sector. As of mid-2019, no commercial bank had provided investment to large-scale clean power plants in the country. The country's rural electrification agency, Funae, has developed mini-grid and pico-solar pilot programs in partnership with German aid agency GIZ and recently signed an agreement with Ignite Power to install individual solar energy systems in 300,000 homes in remote areas of the country. This will reach 1.8 million people over the next three years, and help the country achieve its objective of universal energy access by 2030, established via the Energy for All project (Projecto de Energia para Todos)."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Despite a five-year freeze in the 2010-15 period, retail power prices have risen considerably over the last decade with commercial tariffs climbing more than eightfold, and residential bills more than doubling, as state utility Electricidade de Mo'ambique (EDM) attempts to make up for longstanding revenue shortfalls. As recently as 2017, the regulator increased the tariffs for both the commercial and residential bands by approximately 34%. Industrial prices saw a marginal decrease over the same period, falling from $41.97 to $41.53/MWh. Social tariffs, which apply to low-income users, have remained stable. Like most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Mozambique does not have a wholesale power market, but it does belong to the Southern Africa Power Pool, which is gradually increasing liquidity."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Mozambique's power market is structured around Electricidade de Mo'ambique (EDM), a state-owned and vertically integrated utility responsible for the transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. All power consumers in Mozambique must buy electricity from EDM, which oversees 20% of the country's generating capacity, but purchases power produced by IPPs and the 2.1GW Cahora Bassa Hydro (HCB). The latter is majority owned by the Mozambican state (92.5%). Some 90% of the plant's generation is exported, mostly to South Africa. Cahora Bassa's vast size means that hydroelectric generation dominates Mozambique's power sector, representing 70% of the capacity mix in 2018. A new draft electricity law is expected to overhaul the sector, streamlining the legal framework and clarifying licensing for generation, transmission and distribution. A new regulator, Arene, was stood up in 2017 but is not yet fully operational and will require support to become a strong and independent regulatory body."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Mozambique's power fleet is in need of investment as the country seeks to expand generation capacity to meet growing load and ambitious electrification targets. The Ministry of Energy has published a long-term development plan, the Integrated Electricity Infrastructure Master Plan, which encompasses the southern system and central and northern systems for 2018-2028 and the integrated system through 2029-2043. The Plan envisions new power generation projects totaling 530 MW solar and 150 MW wind, in addition to 4,300 MW of hydro, 1,350 MW of coal and 8,500 MW of gas. Mozambique's electrification rate remains very low at just 29%, and progress in extending access to the wider population has been slow. Power demand continues to grow quickly, with peak consumption nearly doubling since 2010. For on-grid projects, developers can negotiate prices that enable the project to be profitable, but PPAs are negotiated on a case-by-case basis and there is currently no standardized duration for either on- or off-grid projects."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Developers face a difficult investment environment in Mozambique, with the country placing 135th in the World Bank's ease of doing business index in 2018. A lack of standardization and clarity around licensing and concessions, the absence of a strong and independent regulator, as well as the challenging position of vertically integrated utility EDM compound a lack of incentives for renewables. Furthermore, development of vast offshore gas discoveries threatens to divert governmental resources and attention. Project development in Mozambique, whether conventional or mini-grids, remains hamstrung by a lack of regulation. Development of a power plant requires a concession from the government, while the lack of PPA standardization can result in prolonged negotiations with EDM, which is heavily indebted and undergoing major structural and operational changes. Internal politics at the state electricity company remain a potential challenge to project development."}]}
