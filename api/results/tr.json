energy policy","value":"Turkey has ambitious renewables targets across sectors ' it aims to reach 20GW of installed wind capacity, 5GW of solar and 1GW of geothermal by 2023, as well as 34GW of hydro. A boom in unlicensed solar development saw Turkey reach 5GW installed PV capacity by the end of 2018, while the 1GW geothermal target was reached in 2017 due to a generous feed-in tariff. While wind growth has been steady, the 20GW target would require the installation of more than 2GW a year of additional capacity, and policy support has been inconsistent. The site-specific 1GW Yeka auctions have yet to deliver any capacity, with cancelations and delays characterizing the process so far. The feed-in tariff is also due to expire after 2020, with no visibility on support for renewables after that point."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment grew steadily over 2012-2017, with wind leading and accounting for more than $1 billion each year over that period. Solar saw a surge in investment in 2017 as unlicensed projects rushed to commission before transmission costs increased. However, investment in clean energy has stagnated since 2018, amid policy uncertainty and ongoing currency fluctuations and an economic slowdown. Turkey holds auctions for pre-licenses, which are required for renewables projects to reach commissioning. After two auctions held in 2017 only one more, for wind capacity, is planned for April 2020, leaving developers with little scope to bring projects online."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices in Turkey have risen over the last five years, but are still kept low through intervention in the market. Wholesale power prices do not allow power producers to recoup their costs, which are rising along with fuel prices and heightened currency fluctuation. Gas plants especially struggle as the  gas supply has been strained, and resources are diverted toward heat and away from power. BNEF's levelized cost estimate for coal power in Turkey is still the lowest across technologies, due to its high capacity factor, but it does not have the same downward trajectory that wind and PV LCOEs have followed in Turkey over the last five years. Financing costs remain high, however, across all technologies, keeping LCOEs from falling as rapidly as in other regions."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Turkey has undertaken ambitious power-market reforms to privatize and liberalize the sector, and to exploit domestic energy resources. This has primarily meant an emphasis on lignite and hydro, as well as renewables. The government has dialed back its nuclear ambitions, but still plans one 4.8GW Russian-backed plant. Commissioning is unlikely before 2026. The historic dominance of coal generation is likely to continue in the short term, though gas has struggled as the economy slows down. In the 2018 generation mix, coal accounted for 37% and gas 30%. Renewables additions, mainly wind and solar but also geothermal and biomass, are all growing, but face an uncertain future due to a lack of clarity on the feed-in tariff."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"In 2018, Turkey bucked its longer-term trend of adding capacity across all technologies based on the assumption of long-term economic growth and increasing power demand. In 2018 demand slowed, and the first half of 2019 has seen an even more dramatic drop in electricity consumption. The government's prioritization of lignite and emphasis on domestic resources means it is focusing on adding capacity based on energy independence and security of supply rather than just the economics of different technologies. To take advantage of domestic resources, Turkey plans to refit existing coal assets to run off lower-quality domestic lignite rather than imported hard coal ' this should help keep costs down and reduce reliance on imported fuel."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Policy risk is currently a major barrier to new project development, as pre-licenses for development are only allocated via auction. Energy policy overall has remained stable as President Erdogan consolidates his hold on power, but associated currency volatility raises offtaker risks. Turkish utilities already have considerable dollar-denominated debt, while distribution companies are required to pay the generous feed-in tariff in dollars as well. While the lira has fallen against the dollar, offtaker risk has grown accordingly. There is a risk of cuts to the feed-in tariff as the cost of the subsidy grows in relative terms. Local content requirements for renewables in Turkey are high, but the country benefits from a well-developed value chain in most sectors."}]}
