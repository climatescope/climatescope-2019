energy policy","value":"Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is split into two political entities ' the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska. The two regions have separate governments and determine energy policy independently. Each region has a separate feed-in tariff. These schemes have only encouraged the build-out of smaller plants. State utilities have negotiated deals for larger wind farms directly with government. Self-generation is encouraged by offering a premium for the electricity produced. The country also has a target for renewable energy share in gross final energy consumption set through its National Renewable Energy Action Plan submitted to the European Commission. The country aims to reach 40% renewable energy by 2020. The target has already been surpassed due to BiH's significant large-hydro capacity."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The country's first wind farm ' the 50.6MW Mesihovina project ' began producing electricity in March 2018. The facility was built at a cost of $101.4 million. Siemens Gamesa provided the turbines and the project was primarily financed through a loan provided by KfW, a German state-owned development bank. Another wind farm, Podvelezje I, was financed in 2018. A July 2018 tender for the construction of a 65MW solar project was cancelled due to lack of bids. Most renewables investment has come from international concessional lenders, including International Finance Corp., the European Investment Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In addition to domestic funds and government grants, organizations such as the United Nations Development Program, GIZ and USAID provide co-financing as well as technical assistance. Some small-hydro projects are financed by local banks."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Prices are still partially regulated in Bosnia and Herzegovina ' particularly in the region of Republika Srpska. There is not yet complete economic dispatch in the wholesale market in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, meaning prices can be distorted. Residential tariffs are set below the cost-recovery point, which disincentivizes the private sector from investing new power plants. This state of affairs has contributed to the country being four times as energy intensive as the EU average. The highly subsidized residential sector amounts to more than half of final energy consumption. Tariffs have, however, been increasing in recent years."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"BiH's power fleet is roughly split between just over 2.1GW of capacity from five lignite power plants and an equal amount of hydro. The 50.6MW Mesihovina wind farm started operating in March 2018. Renewable energy capacity is minimal, but includes wind, solar, biomass and small hydro. Several further wind farms are planned, including two of 48MW each, in addition to six lignite power plants. While the electricity sector is open to private participation, the overwhelming share of generation and distribution is overseen by three vertically integrated public utilities whose remit is geographically distributed. Some international companies have said they have been forced to partner with a state utility after investing in BiH. NOSBiH operates and balances the grid. The wholesale market does not yet operate transparently and dispatch is not determined on purely economic terms."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The World Bank estimates that BiH is in need of an additional $6 billion for the modernization of its power sector and construction of new generation facilities. Over half of the country's thermal capacity was commissioned in the 1960s and 1970s ' the list of thermal power plants to be closed encompasses 30% of the country's thermal total. Demand has grown strongly since the turn of the millennium, and power generation increased by 50% between 2001 and 2013. As exports more than quadrupled between 2001 and 2010, distribution losses halved in the 2007-10 period. BiH is currently a net electricity exporter, although this could change if no significant generation facilities are brought into service over the next decade."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The country's highly decentralized institutions and fragmented governance structure have long hampered the liberalization of the national electricity sector. Within southeastern Europe, BiH is consistently ranked as the worst performer in reforming its power market. A lack of communication among government departments and licensing procedures involving multiple levels of governance complicate project development. Matters are worsened by the lack of awareness of renewable energy throughout the general population, reducing the political pressure to promote its deployment. Local opposition can also significantly delay renewable energy projects, especially small hydro. In addition, the three public utilities are self-sustaining, but their financial results have worsened in recent years due to poor hydraulic conditions and ageing thermal assets. Curtailment is not an issue given the low level of variable renewables deployment to date."}]}
