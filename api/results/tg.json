energy policy","value":"Togo passed its first renewable energy development law in July 2018, which aims to reach 50% renewables in the national energy mix by 2030. The government also published a roadmap to reach 100% electrification by the same year, thanks to the addition of 108MW of renewable energy projects including solar PV (50MW), hydro, 315 mini-grids and the distribution of 550,000 solar kits. The country is in the process of setting up an open, transparent and easy-to-navigate regulatory framework. The renewable law, published in August 2018, came a year after the launch of the AT2ER (Agence Togolaise d'Electrification Rurale et des Energies Renouvelables), and was followed by a series of decrees detailing the rules that renewable energy project developers should follow."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"There has been no clean energy utility-scale project in Togo yet, but existing rural electrification programs have received both international concessional finance and domestic commercial finance. The government is partnering with off-grid companies to offer solar home systems to rural customers, such as an agreement signed with BBOXX to deliver more than 500,000 PV systems to the rural population over the next five years under the so-called Cizo electrification program. Greenlight Planet, a U.S. company, signed an agreement to deliver more than 300,000 solar home systems under the same scheme, which has the support of local bank Union Togolaise de Banque (UTB). In 2018, the government signed an agreement with German Corporation GIZ, to accelerate rural electrification through training programs."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Togo's challenge is to expand power generation in a cost?efficient manner. The country relies heavily upon imports from the West Africa Power Pool, which provided almost 75% of consumption in 2018. The price of imported hydropower and gas?fired generation ranges from $80 to $120/MWh. To increase its energy security, Togo signed a 25-year PPA with U.S.-based Contour Global in 2010 for a 100MW Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) plant, at offtake prices as high as $170/MWh. Such high offtake prices offer an opportunity for large-scale renewables to be built at a considerably lower cost of generation. On 31 October 2018, Siemens, Eranove and TSK signed a memorandum to work together on the framework for the 65MW K'k'li gas-fired electricity power station, which will supply 30% of the country's electricity needs for 25 years."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Togo's generation is mainly thermal. The country relies on a 100MW Contour Global fossil fuel power plant and also imports significant gas generation from Ghana and Nigeria. The country aims to reach electricity independence by 2030. There has been no large-scale renewable project in Togo to date, although the national electrification and energy independence plan relies heavily on renewable energy build. Under the new renewable energy sector law, renewables benefit from priority dispatch and purchase obligation from the offtaker. Although the power sector is officially open to all players, the CEB (Communauté Electrique du Bénin) still owns most generation capacity in the country, as well as transmission assets. The CEET (Compagnie Energie Electrique du Togo) is responsible for retail."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Togo has a low electrification rate of just 11% in rural areas. The country has developed a roadmap for electrification to reach 100% of the population by 2030. The program combines the distribution of 550,000 solar kits, notably with partners such as BBOXX, developing 315 micro-grids, and extending the distribution grid to remote areas. The level of demand for electricity largely exceeds supply, and increased at a compound annual growth rate of 6.1% between 2013 and 2017. The construction of the first utility-scale PV project (5MW by Eiffage and Neoen) has been proposed several times since 2015, but has been held back by the government wanting to benefit from the steep cost reductions of PV, and the required engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) price renegotiations."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The country has limited energy value chain infrastructure, as no projects of scale have been developed so far. The new energy law has reduced import duties and tariffs, and encourages foreign capital to invest in Togo. The national effort and emphasis on energy sector development, carried by renewables, suggests that bureaucracy should be transparent and in favor of project developers.  One major source of concern is represented by Togo's two power utilities, which have experienced financial distress due to a combination of tariffs that are not cost reflective yet remain unaffordable. Poor revenue collection and operational inefficiencies are at the root of the problem. At the end of 2016, the CEET had accumulated arrears of 44 billion West African francs ($75 million) and arrears from CEET to CEB amounted to 29 billion West African francs ($50 million)."}]}
