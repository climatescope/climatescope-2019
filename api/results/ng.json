energy policy","value":"Nigeria has a handful of clean energy policies, including an ambitious target to achieve 30GW of power generation by 2030, of which 30% is expected to come from renewables.\nThe country's failure to provide a stable electricity grid has created a fertile environment for the decentralized off-grid PV sector to develop. In 2017, Nigeria introduced supportive mini-grid regulation, making it easier for developers to build projects of 100kW to 1MW in size. BNEF estimates that there is 20MW of distributed-PV installed to-date. Building projects with capacity in excess of 1MW often requires time-consuming approvals, such as a generator license. \nIn the on-grid space, the 14 PV developers who signed utility-scale PPAs in 2016 have stalled, due to discrepancies in guarantees or risk measures that the government needs to make, with no certainty as to when or if these will actually be built."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The Rural Electrification Agency (REA) is now commissioning projects under its Energizing Education Program (EEP), providing power for nine universities (seven will run on PV and two on gas) with funding for phase I ($29.7m) coming from Nigeria's sovereign green bond issued in 2017. The REA secured a further $350m loan through the World Bank and $200m (from the AfDB) for the Nigeria Electrification Project (NEP), totaling $550m. EEP phase 2 (19MW of PV) will receive $105m of this fund.\nOn the off-grid side, Daystar Power secured $10 million of equity finance to build 20kW-plus commercial and industrial projects in 2019, provided by Vera Capital and Persistent Energy Capital. Arnergy secured $9 million of equity finance to assist them in achieving their goal of 100MW of PV and 350MWh of lithium-ion storage by 2023, led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures. In 2018, the Bank of Industry (BOI) launched a 6 billion naira ($16.5 million) fund dedicated to solar projects."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices are set by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) under its multi-year tariff-order model. Distribution companies have said that the tariffs are not cost-reflective, and so investment has stagnated. Tariffs have not been updated since 2015 and so do not incorporate the significant drop in the price of solar that has occurred worldwide.\nThe 'yet-to-be-built' on-grid PV projects partially 'agreed' a tariff of $0.075-0.115/kWh, which falls within the range of BNEF's levelized cost of energy for Asia. No wholesale power market exists yet in Nigeria. Instead, NBET brokers transactions between generators and distributors. The 'Eligible Customer' regulation allows bulk buyers to buy directly from a generator at a negotiated PPA rate.\nIn 2018, BNEF carried out a detailed study about on-site solar in Nigeria and found that solar on commercial and industrial premises can cost between $0.1 and 0.2/kWh in Nigeria. PV alone is already cheaper than grid electricity tariffs or electricity from a diesel generator, which typically costs $0.28-0.32/kWh."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Nigeria has no non-hydro renewable energy installed on-grid. Of the 13.5GW total capacity, 84.7% is accounted for by natural gas, 14.5% large hydro, 0.7% off-grid small hydro and 0.1% off-grid distributed PV. Only 7.5GW of the installed capacity is actually available, of which Nigeria generates an annual average of around 3.5 to 4.5GW of electricity.\nGeneration is fully privatized, transmission is government-owned, and distribution is private but with only 11 regional players.\nNigeria aims to create an enabling environment for increasing grid capacity. As of April 2018, distributors must provide metered billing as opposed to the estimated billing system previously in place, in accordance with new regulation."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Nigeria has a very strong solar resource, followed by up to 3.5GW of small hydro. There is little wind resource. In 2016 alone, Nigerians spent a massive $16 billion to power privately-owned diesel/gasoline generators. More than 60% of companies in Nigeria have access to, or rely heavily on, diesel generators, compared to less than 20% in South Africa. The potential for mini-grids in Nigeria is therefore substantial. \nThe on-grid peak demand reported by the government was 20GW in 2018, but actual demand, accounting for off-grid consumption, is likely to be well over 50GW. \nIn 2016, Nigeria announced the Power Sector Recovery Program (PSRP), a series of policy actions, operational, governance and financial interventions to be implemented by the Federal Government of Nigeria between 2017 and 2021, in order to reset the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry for future growth. The World Bank Group expressed its willingness to assist the PSRP with a $2.6 billion loan."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Most major barriers to solar in Nigeria are financial, from debt availability to credit risk and foreign exchange hedges. Many developers in Nigeria wish that import tariffs were reduced and clean energy products prioritized at the ports. \nCurrency convertibly risks are also substantial. Revenue for most solar projects is in Nigerian naira, which international developers need to convert to foreign currency. The Central Bank of Nigeria allocates U.S. dollars to local banks, but applies restrictions on converting naira into U.S. dollars. This poses a huge risk, particularly if a company holds U.S. dollar-denominated debt. As a result, the market is dominated mostly by local players who are more comfortable with owning naira. \nPV modules must pay a 5% import duty plus 5% VAT. Batteries are taxed a total of 25%, made up of 20% import duty and 5% VAT."}]}
