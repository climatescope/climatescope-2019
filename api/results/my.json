energy policy","value":"Malaysia passed the Renewable Energy Act in June 2011, and followed it up with the Renewable Energy (Feed-in Approval and Feed-in Tariff Rate) Rules in the same year. Solar PV, small hydro, biomass and biogas projects were allowed to apply for feed-in tariffs. In 2016, the government announced rules for auctions of large-scale solar power projects (greater than 30MW capacity). The country has been able to hold three rounds of auctions to date. In 2018, Malaysia announced that it targets 20% of its electricity generation from renewable energy sources by 2025. In May 2019, the minister for Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change, Yeo Bee Yin, said that Malaysia is also looking to adopt a more ambitious goal of moving to 100% renewable energy, without specifying a timeline for this goal. The new targets are ambitious, but lower than those set by other countries across the world. Successive governments have however ensured continuity in the country's push to promote renewable energy."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The various policy initiatives like feed-in tariffs and auctions, along with tax and other incentives like the Green Technology Financing Scheme, have contributed to the growth of clean energy investments. About $0.5 billion went into renewable energy projects in Malaysia in 2018. Solar projects continue to garner the most interest, and biogas and small hydro have good potential, whilst biomass consists of mostly legacy assets. In June 2017, the country also issued the world's first green sukuk (Islamic) bond, which was used to finance large-scale solar projects awarded under the first auction for that technology. Investments could pick up in the next few years on the back of various auctions that the government holds from time to time, and the new scheme to promote rooftop PV projects."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Malaysian residential electricity prices are among the cheapest in the region at $54/MWh, while commercial and industrial tariffs are higher, at $94-108/MWh. Average power prices have remained the same across all segments for the last four years. The government has announced that power prices would remain the same at least until the end of 2019. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for renewable energy technologies is still not competitive with conventional generation assets like coal and gas power. Small hydropower projects offer the least-cost renewable energy generation technology, followed by solar. However, in the recent competitive auction held under Malaysia's third round of large-scale solar auctions, the lowest bid for solar power came in at 177 ringgits ($42)/MWh. This is about 55% lower than the lowest bid received in the auctions conducted in 2016."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Coal and gas dominate power generation in Malaysia, and accounted for 75% of the installed capacity and 86% of electricity generation in 2018. This share has largely remained stagnant despite the government's efforts to promote renewable energy. A number of projects awarded under the two large-scale auctions completed in 2016 and 2017 are expected to be commissioned in the next two years. The government is also in the process of awarding an additional 500MW of new projects in the third round of auctions. These projects will help increase the share of solar in installed generation capacity, and generation, in the next three to four years. The electricity sector is partially unbundled, with private participation allowed in electricity generation. Independent power producers account for more than 75% of all power generation assets in Malaysia. The three state owned utilities ' TNB, Serawak Energy and Sabah Electricity ' are the only entities allowed to participate in electricity transmission and distribution. Developers are currently not allowed to enter into power purchase agreements with retail customers. However, the new industry reforms announced in the country in September 2019 propose to allow this for rooftop solar power projects."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Average power demand in Malaysia has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 4% since 2010. The country achieved 100% electrification in 2015. The International Monetary Fund expects Malaysia's economy to grow at 4.7-4.8% annually for the next few years. This, along with greater efforts to improve electricity supply in rural areas, offers room for electricity demand growth in the coming years. The country has a potential for 42GW of rooftop solar power capacity, and 16.5GW of solar on water bodies is possible. Malaysia is also the third-largest PV cell producer in the world. The average age of power generation assets in the country is still low, therefore Malaysia does not have a power plant modernization program."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Foreign investors are not allowed to have majority share-holding in renewable energy assets in the country. This forces foreign companies to tie up with local partners to participate in auctions and other feed-in tariff projects. Additionally, feed-in tariff projects are incentivized to use locally-sourced equipment by providing bonus tariffs. Land for large-scale projects is a growing constraint as much of the available acreage is high-value agricultural land. The average electricity tariff for residential consumers is significantly lower than that for commercial and industrial consumers. The electricity tariffs in the country have been left unchanged for the last four years. This makes it difficult for solar rooftop projects to compete in the residential segment."}]}
