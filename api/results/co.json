energy policy","value":"Colombia�s historically weak policy support for non-hydroelectric sources of renewable energy has resulted in limited wind and solar development in the period before and during 2018. However, in 2019 the government established a mandatory target for electricity distributors supplying regulated markets to procure 10% of their power from clean energy sources from 2022 onwards. Colombia also held its first long-term power auction in 2019, in which it contracted 2.25MW, mainly from solar and wind projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Most investment directed to non-hydro renewable energy in Colombia to date has come from international development banks. From 2010 to 2018, Colombia attracted $1 billion in investment, with 2018 the year that saw a substantial increase on non-hydro investments, with solar attracting $200 million, or 100% of all investment received in the same year."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Colombia is highly dependent on hydroelectric sources, with 70% of generation supplied from hydro on average annually since 2010. Prices are subject to upward pressure from extreme weather, as seen in 2015-16 when a pronounced El Nino effect was observed. Despite that spike, from 2013 to 2016 the country saw an average 30% reduction in retail power prices, across all customer classes. The El Nino draught resulted in an increase of 30% in commercial electricity prices from 2016-2017, from $100.21 to $132.13/MWh; 6% in industrial rates, from $97.03 to $103.56/MWh; and 19% in residential prices, from $123.18 to $147.63/MWh. \nIn 2018, commercial electricity was the only tariff that decreased compared to 2017,  from $132.13 to $115.49/MWh. Industrial electricity prices rose from $103.56 to $105.49/MWh, while residential prices increased from $147.63 to $153.97/MWh.\nGiven Colombia's reliance on large hydro and historically minor progress in developing non-hydro renewable sources, its wholesale power price has been volatile. From 2017 to 2018, wholesale prices spiked 77%, from $36.53 to $64.92/MWh."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Of Colombia's total installed capacity of 17.3GW at year-end 2018, large hydro represented 62% and provided 74% of the 68.9TWh generated that year, followed by natural gas at 10% of generation. Other renewables accounted for 8% of generation, with most coming from small hydro. Capacity additions since 2010 have been dominated by hydro, oil and diesel. Among renewables, Colombia had only 933MW of small hydro, one 18MW wind plant and one 10MW solar plant commissioned in 2017. \nColombia's power market has numerous private and state-owned players across segments but remains concentrated. Government-operated Empresas Publicas Medellín (EPM), together with privately owned Emgesa and Isagen, accounted for 63% of generation in 2018."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The business environment for renewable energy in Colombia is mixed. While the country has seen average electricity demand growth of 2.5% annually since 2010 and has a well-established regulatory framework governing its electricity sector, policies introduced before and during 2018 have done little to accelerate development of non-hydro renewables. The government introduced tax incentives for investments in renewables in Law 1715, effective in 2014. It provides for accelerated depreciation of up to 20% per year for renewable energy investments, income tax deduction of 50% of investment value for up to 50% of taxable income for up to five years, VAT exemption for renewable energy equipment and services and import duty exemption for renewable energy equipment not produced locally. However, it took almost two years from enactment for the law to come into force, so benefits to the market have been limited so far. The off-grid space, or zonas no interconectadas (ZNI), is characterized by a large amount of players, but faces implementation challenges in rural areas."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Investors and developers have reason to be uncertain of the overall potential of Colombia's clean energy market, given ambiguity around long-term planning scenarios, the slow pace and limited effect of policies adopted before and during 2018 and modest official targets. Colombia has no state-owned utility with which to sign long term PPAs; non-regulated industrial consumers are allowed to participate in the competitive market and to sign negotiated, long-term PPAs at unregulated prices. Colombia has an electrification rate of 99 percent."}]}
